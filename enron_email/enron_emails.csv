I see several sales to Puget in Diana's blotter at a $375 price, only one 
with Amerex, and it's for 50 MW. I'll need to get ahold of her in the morning 
to verify the brokers on these. I'll let you know as soon as I do.

Subject: 2001 budget

I need your help...  I did a quick comparison for the 2000 and 2001 budget 
and I am showing a significant increase from last year.  Did we have an 
increase in headcount?  I do not know your actual budget for 2000.  I used 
the information for the last 5 months of 2000 budget to estimate for the year 
(see 2000 Budget tab in the attached file).  The attached file contains the 
following tabs:

 Budget vs Budget Comparison of 2000 vs 2001
 Allocation  Allocation - please allocate the rest of the 21.7% to ENA
 2000 Budget  Estimated 2000 budget based on the last 5 months information
 Research  2001 budget

The calculation for taxes and benefits does not equal to the calculation in 
your template (Corp).  Plus, I have to add A&A overhead cost that Corp will 
bill us for A&A program (line 78).  Can we meet to discuss the allocation to 
ENA and the increase in plan?  I am open all week except for Wednesday 
between 10 and 11.  Thank you.

Bob, I disagree that Alternative 2 is the ""next best thing"" to filing testimony on ripple.  Alternative 2 is the best approach because (as we are pursuing it) we preserve all of our rights and, at the same time, preserve the possibility that this case will go nowhere.

Jim wanted the advantages/disadvantages of the ripple options noted in
my memo.  Here's my take:

Alternative 1 - File ""ripple"" refund claim
Advantages: (1) testimony goes in record and is available for
briefing/argument;(2)procedural risks are minimized.
Disadvantages:  (1) implicitly undermines primary position that refunds
are unjustified; (2)witnesses are available for cross-examination; (3)
ALJ may reject depending on ruling on proposed order.

Alternative 2 - File ""offer of proof"" showing ripple claims
Advantages: (1)next best thing to testimony; (2) keeps burden and focus
on initial claimants', (3) only marginally compromises procedural
position if ALJ accepts proposed order.

Gary/Dan - do you agree? Comments?

We could agree to non exclusive jurisdiction in Tenn., but not exclusive 
jurisdiction.  As for the arbitration forum, my preference would be a major 
regional metro area--Atlanta comes to mind.

		 Subject: TEPAC Distributors Agreement

Recapping our call w/ Keith Simmons (TEPAC's outside counsel) this afternoon, 
we still have the following issues to resolve (the first three are the most 
important to TEPAC).
(1)  Subrogation against TVA -- Keith doubts that TEPAC would ever agree to 
Section 4.5, despite our expressed need to be able to challenge TVA directly 
on its cut of energy we attempt to deliver or its calculation of Replacement 
Costs.  Keith suggested that Jason and Phil speak directly to Larry Hamilton 
about this subject, and they will attempt to do that soon.  
(2)  Mitigation Duty --  They are not comfortable w/ a duty to mitigate 
Replacement Cost damages that are calculated by TVA b/c they cannot foresee 
circumstances where any action or failure to act could have any impact on 
those damages.  We explained that we wanted the Distributors to have every 
incentive to cooperate w/ us in keeping those damages minimized.  They might 
be willing to concede on this point if we can work out everything else.  
(3)  EPMI's Cover Damages --  They are not very comfortable agreeing to the 
concept that a Distributor would have to pay damages to EPMI b/c they cannot 
imagine how they could be responsible for failing to receive an ""into"" 
product such as this.  We both agreed to reconsider this.
(4)  Criteria for Enron's rejection of Distributor -- Our right to approve 
Distributors is ok, but they want to add language to prevent EPMI from being 
arbitrary about those approvals.  We agreed.
(5)  Notice of changes to underlying agreements -- Their duty to notify us it 
ok, but they want to add language that is in line w/ their Distributor 
agreements, which don't absolutely require Distributors to tell TEPAC 
everything.  We agreed.
(6)  Request for offers --  They would prefer that EPMI call them every day 
w/ quotes (which is how Williams does it now), rather than having to initiate 
the process.  We described this as our normal way of doing business and they 
agreed.
(7)  Indemnity clause -- We struck a sentence about each party indemnifying 
the other while they have title to the power, which had been included in our 
earlier draft.  I agreed to look into this.  
(8)  Governing Law and Arbitration -- TEPAC is ok w/ NY law, but would prefer 
including a clause requiring EPMI to sue TEPAC or any distributor in 
Tennessee (even tho Keith thinks that would be the legal result anyway).   
They would also prefer to have the arbitration situs in Tennessee.  We both 
agreed to reconsider this.  Richard:  What do you think about that?

Any comments are welcome.

Regards,
Janice

Chris/Ben,

We had discussed having two change orders so that the ESA stuff is easily 
identifiable/assignable/etc.  Is this still the plan?

I have revised change order #2 to account for the additional scope added by 
ESA.  Please review  and comment.  I did not change the effective date.

A Summary of the Written Comments from our Members and
A Couple of Faculty Members
General Education
Structure: The four-year program with its existing rubric-scheme seems to
make sense, as long as it is an integrated, coherent and distinctive
program. The relation between the general education and majors needs to be
examined and an authoritative body should be charged with the responsibility
of continuously reviewing all programs and the curriculum. There is a
suggestion that Sophomore and Junior level Seminars should be introduced.

According to our catalog (p. 16), the requirements of a Monmouth College
degree involves:
1. Four years of academic work earning at least 124 semester hours.
2. Completion of Freshman Seminar
3. Completion of a major program, and
  4. Completion of the five components of the general
education program:  Language, The Physical Universe and its Life Forms,
Beauty and Meaning in the Works of Art, Human Societies, and Issues and
Ideas.
One comment is that the present rubric scheme is woefully inadequate to the
understanding of the Self for which we need to address metaphysical issues,
epistemological questions, and issues of God, spirit and man.

Freshman Seminar
Monmouth College introduced this course in the early eighties and several
schools have added similar courses to their curriculum in subsequent years.
There seems to be a strong commitment among the faculty and administration
to continue to develop and teach this course. The following are some of the
comments and suggestions:
1.  It is very resource intensive, is trying to do too many things in one
semester, and is quite regimented in its organization and delivery.
Instructors need some flexibility after establishment of clear, limited and
common goals for the course.
2.  We should commit more resources to this venture and a greater proportion
of senior faculty should teach this course.
3.  More stipends and/or release times are needed for the faculty to
continue the development of this course and to provide shadowing experience
to new faculty members who are interested in teaching it.

Language
This component generally makes sense - keep, strengthen and change it. There
is a suggestion to reduce the foreign language requirement and to introduce
more courses on foreign cultures and traditions.
There is an almost universal agreement that our graduates need more
experience in writing, in its several forms, composition, creative writing,
technical writing etc. We think our task force needs to examine carefully
(possibly with a consultant) the concept of Awriting across the curriculum@
and find ways of incorporating it in our academic program.  There is also a
suggestion that we should require composition courses at the Junior and
Senior levels.

Beauty and Meaning in the Works of Art
This component seems to work well. There is a call for a wider range of
choice of courses in this rubric. Perhaps, we should consider some courses
on aesthetics.

Physical Universe and its Life Forms
This component also seems to be working well. The assessment of this rubric
last semester did not call for any radical changes. The Assessment Committee
is satisfied with the goals, concept and delivery of this component. Some
questions were raised on the understanding of the scientific method by our
students.

Scientific literacy is very important in this technological age. Do students
understand the relation between science and technology? There is a call for
courses on History or Philosophy of Science and Science & Society offered by
HT folks.

Human Societies
There is much dissatisfaction with the menu of courses offered beyond
Comparative Societies. This smorgasbord of courses can be replaced by a
slate of 5 to 7 courses, with multiple sections, which address spirituality
in different ways. Another suggestion is to limit this menu to a set of
Introduction to Social Sciences courses and to make Comparative Societies
value-based. It should be noted that our assessment program indicates that
our fifth purpose of exploring Athe spiritual dimension of human existence
and the relationship between faith and knowledge@ is not being addressed by
our academic curriculum.

Issues and Ideas
This course is supposed to provide the culminating experience in our general
education program. It seems to be working well. Can we develop some common
goals for the 15 to 20 courses offered under this rubric? Should we go back
to the two-course Systems of Thought and Belief mode?

Majors
We should plan to review all the current majors. We should strive to provide
a state of the art emphasis in most majors (eg. Molecular Biology,
Computational Dimension in Natural Sciences, Media Concentration, Public
Relations, Sports Management etc.) According to AAC&U, there is a Amuddle in
the middle@ in most major programs. Is there coherence and integration
within the disciplines? How do the majors relate to the general education?
We are expected to make recommendations for adding, modifying, and
eliminating course offerings and programs. May be, when more majors become
attractive and cutting edge, they will stem the tide towards Business and
Education!

Further Suggestions
1.  There is wide support for introducing a Quantitative Reasoning
requirement in our curriculum. There is a relevant article in our red
folder. We may have to look at Abest practices@ in peer institutions and
work with a regional consultant to see how this can be implemented.
2.  How do we educate our students to make value-based decisions in this
fast-changing and complex world? Many schools have introduced Ethical
Inquiry/Moral Reasoning requirement in their curriculum. There are two
relevant articles in our red folder. Again, we may want to look at Abest
practices@ in peer institutions or work with a regional consultant to see
how this can be implemented.
3. We need to introduce course requirements under the broad category of
Internationalization, Globalization and Cultural Diversity in our
curriculum.
4. Do we need to develop courses that explicitly deal with Modes of Inquiry,
Critical Thinking, Logical Reasoning, Problem Solving etc.?

Other General Considerations Related to Curricular Review
1.  The six questions Dean Arnold has raised on the articulation of our
curricular goals, understanding the needs of our students and the world they
are entering into and the allocation of resources.
2.  The implications of the Teagle grant - Adoing nothing is not a viable
option@ and if we come up with strong initiatives, management support may be
forthcoming.
3.  Simplify the process for curricular initiatives, streamline the budget
process and review our style of management.
4.  There is no ongoing support for Instruction Technology and our current
policies and procedures continue to frustrate folks, especially some of our
newer faculty.
5. Our semester schedule is anathema to aims of a serious, liberal arts
education: the semester system breeds fragmentation, superficiality,
freneticism, hyperactivity and resentment.
5.  We need to continue to address the work load issue."

I think that sounds like a great idea. It doesn't really serve a purpose to 
have all the time zones as a choice in Deal Blotter if EnPower is going to 
sort them out anyway. We're just doubling up on the work that the application 
already knows how to do. In the meantime, I'll sort through these deal 
numbers and change time zones that flow over the first week in April. Let me 
know if that sounds good.

Yep, the time zone glitch.  I think he was looking at all deals in the 
system.  I almost think we should deal with this April, and worry about the 
rest when it comes up.   Will and I are also kicking around making the only 
choice in deal entry PPT.  Let Enpower sort out the rest.  We can modify 
stuff on the strip level, but PPT would be the only choice in blotter and at 
the top of regular deal entry.

How does that sound?

I'm unclear as to what Will found in these deals that needs to be looked at. 
The first one (scary!!) has notes in the comments section of each leg that 
say it was terminated on 9/30/98; however, there are still forward deal legs 
that haven't been killed or zeroed out. I don't think I could consider myself 
a deal control professional on this one - I'll need to talk to a trader. But 
let me know what you want me to look for in the remaining deals. Is this part 
of the time zone glitch?

It will mean doing the paperwork all over again and closing the old account assuming ECTEF does not want an account.  This is not a name change but actually a transfer from one entity to another.  It will likely require resolutions to open brokerage accounts for ECTMI if they don't already have them in place.

Aside from looking foolish to Bear I anticipate no hassles from them.  As far as our side it would be wise to have legal give their estimation of the effort and time frame needed to duplicate the effort that was made for ECTMI.

Sara how feasible would it be to prepare account paperwork for the ECTMI company to obtain a Bear account?

Thanks,

Tom

After speaking with David Wall about which entity the Anker debt and equity should be moved to, I placed a few quick phone calls.  I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.

The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.

I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron's corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.

If you have any further questions or if I can be of further assistance, please contact me at ext. 35882.

I completely agree.  

I think that this needs to be one of our messages to the CPUC - I think that
once the aggregate % is exposed, it will not seem as frightening to the
CPUC.  Also, what if one of our messages to the CPUC speaks to the fact that
they got what they want - no more customers will be signed to direct access,
but don't retroactively suspend or retroactively assign arbitrary exit fees.

Importance: High


I think there would be value in the various companies on this distribution
who are serving direct access to be able to show that the amount of load now
being served or recently signed up is not significant enough to jeopardize
payment of the bonds. Anything less may not erase fears. Showing that the
Constitutional impariment of contracts issue will cost more and do more
damage than grandfathering those now seems to be one of the strongest
courses of action for the Sept. 4 pleading. Perhaps Dan could confidentially
be told generally how much load has or will have access by Sept 1 and he
could aggregate the number and then it could be  compared to the amount of
long/or short supply is for the UDCs compared to the load left to pay for
it. What  do you think?

Subject: CRITICAL!! IMMEDIATE REVIEW NEEDED


THE COMMISSION HAS ISSUED A REVISED DRAFT OF THE BARNETT DECISION TODAY
WHICH RETROACTIVELY SUSPENDS DIRECT ACCESS TO JULY 1.
 
The cover letter states as follows:  
 
""This version differs from the draft mailed on August 15, 2001 in several
ways. First, the effective date of the suspension has been changed from
September 1, 2001 to July 1, 2001 (as proposed in the draft mailed June 15,
2001). Second, the draft decision clarifies that customers who have executed
direct access contracts prior to July 1, 2001 may continue to receive power
from electric service providers for the initial term of the contracts.
Several other editorial and explanatory changes have also been made. 
 
Assembly Bill No. 1 from the First Extraordinary Session (AB1X) requires
that direct access be suspended until the Department of Water Resources no
longer supplies power to the customers of the three largest regulated
electricity companies. It directs that the Commission determine the
effective date of the suspension. In order to reduce the possibility of harm
to customers and to resolve potential conflict, parties should comment on:
(1) whether AB1X suspends the entire direct access program, including all
transactions under that program, (2) how the Commission can comply with AB1X
if it exempts written contracts for direct access executed before July 1,
2001 from the suspension, and (3) whether July 1, 2001 is an appropriate
date for the suspension......Comments on the draft decision are permitted.
Those comments are to be electronically served on the service list (for
those who have electronic addresses) no later than 10:00 a.m. on September
4, 2001, and shall be filed with the Commission by 5:00 p.m. on that date.""
 
The specific wording in the Decision is:
 
""The Legislature has directed this Commission to suspend direct access until
DWR no longer procures power for the retail end-users, and we find it should
be suspended effective July 1, 2001.  The Legislative direction is clear;
and the suspension should apply to SCE, Pacific Gas and Electric Company
(PG&E), and San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E).  In the interest of
providing cost stability for current direct access customers, written
contracts for direct access signed before July 1, 2001 are exempt from the
suspension for the initial term of the contracts.""
 
It also provides that:

""In comments on the draft decision, several parties questioned the need for
the Commission to implement the legislative suspension of direct access as
soon as July 1, 2001.  By the draft decision mailed for comment to the
parties on June 15, 2001, market participants were provided notice that
direct access would be suspended as of July 1, 2001.  The Commission
postponed its consideration of the draft decision.  However, we do not
change the effective date of the suspension.  The underlying legislation was
introduced on January 3, 2001, enrolled and sent to the Governor on February
1, 2001, and signed by the Governor the same day.  Market participants have
now had eight months since then to prepare for this event.  We do not wish
to reward customers who have switched to direct access since July 1, 2001 in
the hope that we would change the effective date of the suspension when this
switch could disadvantage customers who continue to receive bundled service
from the utility."" 

The decision also states that no parties have raised any factual issues
which would justify hearings, which presumably, although not explicitly,
disposes of the joint AReM/WPTF filing.  I presume we will want to file in
strong opposition.  Suggestions on strategy?  It might be a good idea to
have a conference call on this and get started immediately with raising a
movement to counter this.

Paul,

Attached is a spreadsheet with the deals for HRLY NE for 10-15 thru 10-19.  It appears that most of the deals are financial deals done at R1E (Westhub), R1C (NY West), and R1B (Nepool).  These deals all have financial true-ups that come through in the financial liquidations line on your P&L.  I have tried to break the liquidations values down deal by deal.  When looking at the deals, please note that the liquidation amounts are the opposite value that they appear on the spreadsheet.  For instance, looking in the highlighted yellow column, the value should be the opposite value shown.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks

Tom, 

Here are the fault paretos of fault counts for all sites for May 2002 
(may2002paretos_faults.pdf). For readability only the top 30 faults for each 
site are displayed. Both Texas sites had VERY high numbers of ""wind 
deviation"" faults.

I am also attaching a file (from a different work request) that has a pareto 
(by site) of the mean number of faults per turbine (may2002mean_faults.pdf), 
which shows that the Texas sites have the highest mean faults per turbine. 
This also has boxplots of the number of faults by site to show the outliers.

I will do the June data, if still desired, when the data upload is completed.

As always, if you have questions or comments let me know.

Mark

Duude,
What's happening? Finally getting around to getting
you my new email and tele #. I left Pru back in
mid-December and have been running non-stop with the
new job. It is a world of difference going from Corp
America to a start-up, but its been fun.

Been doing some traveling and spending a lot of time
trying to get new customers and servicing the ones we
sign up.

So how was N.O.? I'm sure that the three of you didn't
do any drinking or got into any trouble.

Tell the lovely Mrs. Ruscitti that we say hello. Don't
forget, let me know the next time you are in Jersey
and if you have time we should hook up.

I had bookmarked Mr. Conway's email on my computer at
Pru and forgot to take it with me, can you send it to
me. Thanks and talk to you soon,

Jeffrey,

Wow.  What can I say.  Will it help?  It covers about thirty months of
rent here (and I have a nice place), and makes it nearly certain that I
have the wherewithall to hang in there long enough to give this writing
thing an umitigated shot.  Thanks so very much.

Thanks also for for the kind words in your letter about appreciating
getting my little blurbs.  That means a lot to me.

Your letter capped what was one of my best days here (and I have had a
lot of great days here).  Have met a ""harika [wonderful]"" Turkish woman,
and had just spent a fine evening with her when I came home and found
your letter.  Her name is Sukran (pronounced ""Shoo-kron"").  More about
her later.  I have to admit that I cried a bit after I opened your
letter; the culmination of a lot of fantasitic feelings.

It would be great if you got over here.  It's really an endlessly
facinating place, and I think I'm becoming a prtty good guide.  (Also,
Sukran should be helping my Turkish a lot.)  Let me know as far ahead of
time as possible so I can sure you have the best choices of hotels.

I know my blurbs suggest greyness, but that's the most interesting color
for me.  As I mentioned in my last e-mail to you, I'm having the time of
my life.  Indeed, today is the first real day of spring here (though it
may be a false one [ it snowed pretty hard just two weekends ago]) and I
actually sat out in the sun on the porch next to my place and studied
Turkish and prepared my next English lessons.

I recently sent Kristin an ""introduction to Istanbul"" e-mail (we just
got in touch by e-mail after the holidays); you may want to ask her to
run off a copy for you (assuming she saved it).

Hope you're enjoying your work.  Let me know what else is happening in
your life.  Thanks again for everything.

Love,

Mark

Enron's Net Soars, Despite Telecom Loss, Gaining 40% Amid Strong Energy Units
By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

07/13/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A2
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. posted a 40% increase in second-quarter net income, reflecting 
the enormous profitability of its energy marketing and trading enterprise, 
which was sufficient to offset wider-than-expected losses at its 
telecommunications unit. 
The Houston company had net income of $404 million, compared with $289 
million a year earlier, on revenue that nearly tripled to $50 billion. 
Earnings per share rose 32% to 45 cents from 34 cents.
Enron was lifted by exceptionally strong electricity- and gas-trading 
volumes. In North America, natural-gas volumes jumped 9% and 
electricity-trading volumes jumped 71%. In Europe, where Enron is pushing 
aggressively into newly deregulated markets, trading volumes for gas more 
than doubled and for electricity leapt to almost five times those of before. 
From practically nothing just two years ago, Europe generates one-quarter of 
Enron's energy-trading volumes. 
Profits from trading more than compensated for a $101 million loss posted for 
the company's telecommunications business that analysts had, until recently, 
proclaimed would soon generate more income than Enron's energy business. For 
the quarter, bandwidth-service revenue was $16 million. The unit posted a 
loss of $8 million for the year-earlier quarter. 
Enron's chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling, said prices for capacity on 
fiber-optic networks, such as the one Enron has built, have been ""dropping 
like a rock. . . . We've been shocked at the extent."" 
Mr. Skilling said the company is trying to boost revenue by focusing on 
fiber-optic delivery of data and entertainment -- ""a narrow piece of the 
business but about all that's left"" -- and is hoping the glut in capacity 
will evaporate as competitors go broke. He said companies that continue to 
invest, despite the ""market meltdown,"" and keep their networks state of the 
art will be rewarded eventually. 
Enron's results beat analysts' expectations, but several said they fear 
softening electricity prices throughout the nation, and particularly in the 
West, could crimp third-quarter results. ""Enron benefited from unusual price 
volatility,"" during the quarter, said Raymond Niles, an energy analyst for 
Salomon Smith Barney. But it is uncertain whether that will continue with a 
general softening of natural-gas and electricity prices across the country, 
most notably in the West. 
Mr. Skilling said he thinks California may have seen the worst of its energy 
crisis. He consistently has said he doesn't think Enron's earnings will be 
significantly affected by possible refund orders from federal energy 
regulators or other regulatory intervention. 
He added that Enron was pleased with steps the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission took this week to encourage the formation of four big 
electric-transmission grid operators in the West, the Northeast, the 
Southeast and the Midwest.

Enron Net Rose 40% in Quarter
Bloomberg News

c. 2001 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, July 12 -- The Enron Corporation, an energy trader, said today that 
its second-quarter profit rose 40 percent as its sales of natural gas and 
electricity surged in the United States and Europe. 
Net income rose to $404 million, or 45 cents a share, from $289 million, or 
34 cents, in the period a year ago, Enron said. Results beat analysts' 
estimates by 3 cents a share.
Revenue almost tripled to $50.1 billion. Enron, which is based in Houston, 
sold almost twice as much power in North America and five times as much in 
Europe than in the quarter a year ago. 
Although electricity and natural gas prices surged in California, Jeffrey K. 
Skilling, the chief executive of Enron, said the state ''is just not a big 
factor'' in Enron's increasing profits. The company bolsters earnings by 
increasing sales of energy and other commodities like lumber and steel rather 
than by raising prices, analysts said. 
''That's the nature of the commodities business,'' said Zach Wagner, an 
analyst with Edward Jones & Company. ''As markets open up, their volumes will 
grow. Their margins are basically flat.'' 
Enron's profit margin was less than 1 percent last year and has averaged 2.1 
percent the last five years, based on Bloomberg data. That compares with a 
profit margin of 6.5 percent for Exxon Mobil, the largest publicly traded 
energy company. 
Shares of Enron have dropped 31 percent the last year, despite steadily 
increasing earnings, and sales that now rival those of Exxon Mobil. Shares of 
Enron rose 45 cents today, to $49.55. 
Enron was expected to make 42 cents a share in the quarter, the average 
estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.

Credit Markets
Treasury Prices Climb as More Money Is Shifted To U.S. Bonds on Weakness of 
Emerging Markets
By Michael Mackenzie and Andrew Gelfand
Dow Jones Newswires

The Wall Street Journal
C12
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Treasury prices closed higher as renewed weakness in emerging 
markets prompted investors to shift more money into the U.S. bond market. 
It is common for Wall Street traders to bid Treasurys higher when weakness in 
other markets seems likely to spur flows into Treasurys, which are viewed as 
a haven.
But yesterday's action involved more than just Wall Street firms and provided 
substantial support, mostly offsetting the bearish influence of a stock 
rally. ""Argentina is keeping a good bid in the [Treasury] market,"" said Peter 
Cordrey, managing director at Prudential Investment Management in New Jersey. 
Much of the focus again was Argentina, whose long-term sovereign credit 
rating yesterday was cut by Standard & Poor's to single-B-minus from 
single-B. 
S&P said the ratings outlook for Argentina remained negative and cited 
""growing strain on the cohesion of the governing coalition and the risk that 
it may impede efforts by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo to implement 
draconian measures to balance the federal budget."" 
That country is ""just looking worse and worse every time you turn around,"" 
said Drew Matus, market economist with Lehman Brothers in New York. 
Despite indications that Argentine officials are trying to win agreement on 
spending cuts, investors remained nervous about the nation's ability to 
service its large external debt burden. Prices of Argentine floating-rate 
bonds fell about 103/8 points to 623/8. 
In U.S. Treasury trading, meanwhile, the benchmark 10-year note at 4 p.m. EDT 
was up 8/32 point, or $2.50 per $1,000 face value, at 98 6/32. Its yield fell 
to 5.242% from 5.276% late Wednesday, as yields move inversely to prices. 
The 30-year Treasury bond's price was up 14/32 at 96 1/32 to yield 5.652%, 
down from 5.684% Wednesday. 
Shorter Treasury maturities preformed less strongly than longer ones, and 
analysts cited gains in stocks as a reason. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 237.97 points to 10478.99, and the 
Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 103.70 points to 2,075.74. Treasurys are being 
""pulled in two directions, and the stock market is winning in the [short] 
end,"" said Richard Gilhooly, senior bond strategist at Paribas Capital 
Markets in New York. 
Another factor bolstering Treasurys was economic news. In two early releases, 
the Labor Department reported both a huge rise in claims for state 
unemployment benefits and slightly lower prices for imported goods. 
The number of workers filing first-time applications for jobless benefits 
jumped by 42,000 to 445,000 in the week ended July 7, the highest level since 
about mid-1992. That raised the four-week moving average to 410,750 claims. 
Today, two other economic reports may dominate the attention of bond 
investors: the producer price index and retail sales, both for June. 
A Dow Jones Newswires/CNBC survey found that economists believe the PPI was 
unchanged in June and will show a slight 0.1% increase in the month excluding 
food and energy. ""The friendly inflation news should help to keep a bid in 
long [dated] Treasurys,"" said Gemma Wright, a bond-market strategist at 
Barclays Capital in New York. 
A separate Dow Jones Newswires poll found that economists expect to see a 
0.3% rise in overall retail sales in June, or a 0.2% sales gain excluding 
automobiles. 
Corporate Bonds 
Marlin Water Trust II sold $475 million and 515 million euros ($439 million) 
of securities via Credit Suisse First Boston and Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. 
In 1998, Enron Corp. created a special-purpose entity, to finance the 
purchase of water utility Wessex Water PLC of the United Kingdom. Yesterday's 
issue was a refinancing of that debt, but was done in a way that keeps the 
debt off Enron's balance sheet, underwriting officials said. 
The U.S. portion of the deal was priced to yield 6.31%, or 2.25 percentage 
points over Treasurys. In early trading, it was quoted at 2.25 percentage 
points over Treasurys, which was ""reasonably positive on a day when the 
corporate market was so jittery,"" said Stephen Kane, portfolio manager at 
Metropolitan West Asset Management. 
Generally, investment-grade corporate bonds weakened on concerns about 
emerging markets. Yield margins to Treasurys, an important performance gauge, 
widened by 0.05 to 0.10 percentage point. 
Separately, Citigroup Inc. tapped the market with $2 billion of two-year 
global floating-rate notes priced to yield 0.09 percentage point over 
three-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor. 
Agency Securities 
Fannie Mae sold $2.5 billion of callable benchmark securities, which traded 
strongly afterward. 
Its $1.5 billion of 5.5%, five-year notes yielded 5.5657%, or 0.05 percentage 
point over the Fannie Mae benchmark level on an option-adjusted spread basis. 
An additional $1 billion of 6.25%, 10-year notes yielded 6.408%, or 0.03 
percentage point over the Fannie Mae benchmark level on an option-adjusted 
basis. 
Scott Graham, head of agency trading at Greenwich Capital Markets, said his 
company saw ""a number of customers"" who don't typically consider callable 
issues, but were nonetheless looking to buy some of the new securities.

THE ENERGY CRISIS Some State Energy Consultants Own Generators' Stock Ethics: 
They negotiate deals and buy electricity from power firms. GOP officials 
claim credit for forcing the disclosure of potential conflict.
ERIC BAILEY
TIMES STAFF WRITER

07/13/2001

SACRAMENTO -- More than half a dozen consultants hired by the state to 
purchase electricity and to negotiate long-term power deals own stock in 
generating companies such as Calpine and Enron that have profited handsomely 
during California's energy crisis. 
The potential conflict of interest emerged Thursday with the release of 
financial disclosure statements by consultants who have been hired by the 
state since the start of the power crunch.
Among those disclosing stock ownership were two key negotiators of long-term 
energy contracts and two workers hired to purchase electricity from 
generators, including some of the firms in which they hold an interest. 
Several other consultants who played key roles in the state's energy efforts 
decided not to file financial disclosure statements, citing legal exemptions 
under state law. 
Among those who did not file the financial disclosure statements were a pair 
of executives at two Wall Street firms that stand to make $14 million if the 
state buys California's power grid. Of about 50 consultants hired by the 
state in the past six months, 27 filed the disclosures. 
The disclosures follow a firestorm in Sacramento last month over the hiring 
by Gov. Gray Davis of two media consultants also employed by Southern 
California Edison, the troubled utility that is negotiating with the state 
over a bailout package. 
Steve Maviglio, a Davis spokesman, said the governor's legal staff was 
reviewing the financial disclosure forms for any potential conflicts of 
interest. 
""If there's anything inappropriate,"" Maviglio said, ""then we'll deal with 
it."" 
Republicans, however, said the hired workers had revealed overt conflicts 
that clearly violated state law. 
Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican running for governor against 
Davis next year, said the revelations call into question the work performed 
by the consultants on high-priced energy contracts that are ""going to 
mortgage our children's future for decades to come."" 
""If you show a conflict, the potential is there for collusion,"" Jones said. 
""I'm not accusing anyone, but that's why you have disclosure."" 
Rob Stutzman, a state GOP spokesman, said he was particularly troubled 
because the consultants had delayed filing the disclosure forms for months. 
Under state law, the forms are supposed to be submitted within 30 days after 
the consultants go to work for the state. 
Most of the energy consultants, who could not be reached for comment, 
reported owning relatively small amounts of stock in energy firms, generally 
less than $10,000. 
But one of the new workers, William Mead, disclosed that he owned between 
$100,000 and$1 million in Calpine, a San Jose-based energy firm. Mead did not 
report when the stock had been purchased. 
Only one of the contractors reported selling off stock after coming to work 
for the state. 
Vikram Budhraja, president of Pasadena-based Electric Power Group LLC, on 
Jan. 11 purchased between $10,000 and $100,000 in stock of Dynegy, a 
electricity and natural gas producer. He sold it off on Jan. 29, 10 days 
after he came to work for the state. Budhraja has been a top negotiator of 
the state's long-term energy contracts, which have included a deal concluded 
March 2 with Dynegy. 
Richard Ferreira, a retired Sacramento Utility District executive hired by 
the state to negotiate long-term power contracts, reported the purchase of 
between $2,000 and $10,000 of stock in Calpine, a San Jose-based energy firm, 
in August 2000. He also purchased a similar amount of stock in General 
Electric Co., which produces power plant equipment, in April 2000. 
Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, reported that he owned an undisclosed 
amount of stock in Enron Corp., a big Texas-based energy firm. Elaine Griffin 
purchased between $10,000 and $100,000 in Calpine stock on Feb. 1, less than 
three weeks before she came to work for the state as an energy trader. 
Constantine Louie, an energy scheduler, reported owning between $10,000 and 
$100,000 in Calpine stock. 
Republicans took credit for forcing the Davis administration to file the 
reports, a charge the governor's office brushed aside. 
Jones, the secretary of state, held a news conference Tuesday to complain 
about the failure of nearly all the state's energy consultants to file any 
sort of financial disclosure forms. The statements were only made available 
late in the afternoon Thursday, months after many consultants went to work 
for the state. 
Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said the delays were explained in part by 
negotiations that began in March with the Fair Political Practices 
Commission, the state's ethics watchdog, to determine if the consultants were 
required to file the forms. 
He also suggested that Jones' accusations were fueled more by campaign 
politics than any devotion to constitutional duty. 
""One needs to question why the secretary of state is using taxpayer money to 
investigate something beyond his jurisdiction,"" Maviglio said. ""That's why we 
have an FPPC, to look at these kinds of things.""

THE ENERGY CRISIS Plan Uses Public in Refund Demand Legislature: Democrats' 
proposal to pressure 'greedy' firms is attacked by GOP as political ploy.
CARL INGRAM
TIMES STAFF WRITER

Los Angeles Times
Home Edition

SACRAMENTO -- The Democratic-led state Senate intends to fill constituent 
mailboxes with a taxpayer-financed appeal urging Californians to demand 
nearly $9 billion in energy price refunds from ""greedy out-of-state power 
generators."" 
Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) said the mailers will ask 
Californians to join the Senate and Gov. Gray Davis in insisting that the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order the refunds of alleged overcharges.
Senate Democrats set the high target despite a federal mediator's ruling 
against Davis earlier this week. The mediator said California would be 
entitled to only about $1 billion in generator overcharges, not the $8.9 
billion that Davis has fought for. 
Senate officers said the cost of the mail campaign will be paid from the 
budgets of senators, at taxpayer expense, as part of the Legislature's 
constituent service mail program. 
But Republicans attacked the mailer as political propaganda that may violate 
state law and Senate policy barring issuance of ""partisan"" documents at 
public expense. 
Sketchy details of the quietly developed project surfaced on the Senate floor 
Thursday. Staffers who worked on it said it was virtually impossible to 
calculate the program's cost. 
But they indicated that if all 26 Democrats agreed to send up to 30,000 
mailers each to constituents, the postage alone would cost $140,400. 
If each mass mailing exceeded 30,000 pieces, a higher postage rate would 
apply, raising the cost, officials said. 
In the mailer, constituents are asked to return an attached card to their 
state senator, urging ""full refunds of the outrageous prices charged by the 
greedy out-of-state power generators."" 
Cynthia Lavagetto, manager of the Senate mail program, said each member will 
decide what do do with the returned cards, including simply filing them or 
sending them on to FERC. 
Lavagetto said a prototype mailer was prepared with the help of the Select 
Committee on Citizen Participation, a panel that has no chairman or members, 
since it has not been activated this year. But it does maintain an office and 
has three staffers on the Senate payroll. 
Burton dismissed the Republican charges of partisanship as baseless. ""We do 
this all the time on a variety of issues,"" he said. ""We're saying, 'Stop 
stealing California's money.' "" 
But Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine, the Senate's senior Republican, denounced 
the mailing as clearly partisan. He said it appeared to reflect a developing 
2002 election strategy of Davis and Democrats to blame the FERC and 
out-of-state generators for California's energy mess. 
""I seriously question the appropriateness of using taxpayer money to get 
people to lobby [for the refunds],"" Johnson said. 
Johnson and Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside) suggested that Democrats turn their 
criticism to municipal utilities, including the Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power. Some utilities charged the state even higher prices last 
winter than did private generators. 
""Why are they not attacking the DWP?"" Johnson asked. 
He noted that S. David Freeman was running the DWP at the time some of its 
highest prices were charged to the state, which is buying power for 
California's financially crippled utilities. Later, Davis hired Freeman as 
his top energy price negotiator. 
""Doesn't David Freeman more properly belong in that same jail cell as the guy 
called Spike than he does in the governor's office?"" Johnson asked. 
""Spike"" has become a character in the California energy debate, thanks to 
Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, who is investigating whether power sellers engaged 
in price-gouging and antitrust behavior. 
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal in May, Lockyer said he would 
""love to personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8-by-10 
cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi. My name is 
Spike, honey.' ""

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Surging energy sales behind Enron advance.
By JULIE EARLE.

07/13/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Enron, the US energy trader, yesterday posted a 40 per cent rise in 
second-quarter profits to $404m, due to surging gas and electricity sales in 
North America and Europe. 
The Houston-based company also said it would continue to grow aggressively in 
Europe and seize any opportunities to expand in the US, after regulators on 
Wednesday ordered the formation of an organisation to open the North American 
electricity market.
Jeff Skilling, Enron chief executive, said the company had its sights set on 
Europe for strong earnings growth, which it hopes will eventually match North 
America. 
The company's wholesale business unit, the group's main profit driver, 
derives 70 per cent of its business from North America. 
""We see more growth opportunity in Europe than in North America. Gas volumes 
are up more than 100 per cent (in the quarter),"" Mr Skilling said. ""The gas 
and electric market in Europe is almost as big as North America and we got an 
early start."" 
Mr Skilling said a decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to 
order the formation of four grid organisations to optimise the transmission 
of electricity in parts of the US was hugely important. 
He estimated only 20 per cent of the wholesale market for electricity could 
be accessed and the decision would take this to 90-95 per cent. 
Mr Skilling said Enron, which has transformed itself from a pipeline company 
into a large energy trader, was focused on its volumes, not revenues, which 
jumped to $50.1bn in the quarter, from $16.9bn a year ago. 
The only poor performer was the broadband division, which trades space on 
fibre-optic networks. The unit posted a loss of $102m in the quarter, against 
an $8m loss a year ago, and the company said it would cut costs there. 
Enron's result of $404m, or 45 cents a share, compared with $289m, or 34 
cents, in the same quarter a year ago. 
Analysts had been expecting 42 cents a share. 
By the close in New York, the company's shares were trading 45 cents higher 
to $49.55. See Lex.

Lex - Enron.

07/13/2001
Financial Times - FT.com
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Be careful of the company you keep. Having enjoyed its status as a 
telecommunications play last year, Enron is now suffering with its new 
friends. The US energy trader has dropped by 40 per cent since the start of 
the year - underperforming the market by a third - despite the earnings 
momentum in its core energy trading business. 
A 40 per cent increase in net income in the second quarter, even allowing for 
inevitable questions over earnings quality, is impressive. The strength of 
the energy trading business, with volumes up by almost 60 per cent, is more 
than enough to offset the misery in the broadband trading business.
However, the broadband division's $102m losses are shocking, even in these 
difficult times. The market has collapsed, partly owing to credit problems in 
the telecoms sector. Enron's cost base is completely out of kilter with the 
opportunity. At least it should not be too hard to put that right. Actual 
investment in assets is limited; and by reallocating staff to the 
fast-growing energy trading divisions, restructuring costs can be kept to a 
minimum. 
Broadband is not the only worry. California's troubles have not affected 
trading volumes, but regulatory risk remains, while promises on asset sales 
have not been met. Trading on 23 times 2002 forecast earnings, the valuation 
looks fair for a fast-growing trading company. The upside lies in convincing 
investors to give the company more credit for its value-added risk management 
services. The long-term potential of broadband trading, meanwhile, is thrown 
in for free.

White House adviser targeted for dealings with Salvation Army
By RON FOURNIER
AP White House Correspondent

07/13/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Senior White House adviser Karl Rove, increasingly a target 
of criticism from Democrats and Republicans, wound up at the center of a new 
storm over his dealings with the Salvation Army. 
White House aides rallied to his side, and Rove was unapologetic. But 
Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe called for 
congressional hearings.
""I think the truth needs to come out,"" McAuliffe said Thursday. ""Let's have 
hearings and get to the bottom of this."" 
At issue was the Salvation Army's push for a regulation allowing religious 
charities to practice workplace discrimination against gays, and Rove's 
actions on behalf of the group. Rove said he was simply doing his job. 
While McAuliffe called for hearings, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, 
D-S.D., seemed less riled. ""Karl Rove is a very respected individual and I 
wouldn't have any comment to make,"" Daschle said. 
Thursday's flap was not the first for Rove, who oversees politics, strategy 
and public liaison at the White House. 
When Sen. James Jeffords bolted the GOP and turned the Senate over to 
Democrats last month, Republicans accused Rove of alienating the Vermont 
lawmaker during the tax-cut debate. He was fingered, too, for not warning 
Bush earlier that Jeffords might jump ship. 
When Rove sat in White House meetings on policy that could impact his stock 
portfolio, Democrats demanded to know whether his holdings with Houston-based 
Enron Corp. and Intel Corp. created a conflict of interest. 
When Bush crossed some military advisers and suspended Navy bombing on the 
Puerto Rican island of Vieques, Rove's involvement in the case was held up as 
proof by critics that the decision was politically-motivated. 
Rove's involvement in the Salvation Army case has stirred debate in 
Republican and Democratic circles about whether he wields too much power and 
is too political for the White House. 
The White House rejected the Salvation Army's request Wednesday, but only 
after the revelation of an embarrassing Salvation Army memo. The memo said 
the administration had promised to issue a regulation protecting it and other 
religious charities from efforts to prevent such discrimination in exchange 
for the Salvation Army's support of Bush's plan to open government programs 
to religious groups. 
White House officials left the impression that no senior officials were 
involved in the discussions, failing to point out Rove's activity until 
Thursday. 
In a telephone interview, Rove said he recalled having just three or four 
brief discussions on the topic. He received a request from a Salvation Army 
ally to looked into the rule, sent the ally to the White House faith-based 
office, forwarded the written request to a government lawyer and was told 
later by the lawyer, ""We're not certain there's anything we can do."" 
The lawyer, Jay Lefkowitz, told reporters the request lay dormant after his 
discussion with Rove. 
Rove rejected the criticism. ""My job is not to say, `Don't send me something 
or call me.' My job is to keep my eyes and ears open and send things to the 
appropriate departments,"" he said. 
Some top Republicans outside the White House said Rove has become a 
lightening rod. 
""Part of his role is to be a deflection shield for the president,"" said GOP 
consultant Rich Bond. ""Everytime Karl takes a hit, it's one less hit the 
president has to take. Karl knows that and he is a big boy."" 
Aides say the president is not troubled by Rove's actions, even joking about 
the controversies. 
White House chief of staff Andrew Card also defended Rove. 
""I may be naive, but we have no problem of division on the senior level,"" 
said Card. ""I was in the Reagan White House when we had three clear camps ... 
We don't have that here."" 
Aides do acknowledge, however, that there is some resentment of Rove in the 
lower ranks of the White House. Some grumbled that Rove did not let White 
House press secretary Ari Fleischer know Wednesday about his involvement in 
the Salvation Army case. Others, still tired from a tough campaign and 
frustrated by their new jobs, said they resent Rove's wide reach.

UK: Bidder list for Southern Water grows-report.

07/13/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - More potential bidders have emerged that may 
challenge Italian utility ENEL for Southern Water, the British regional 
utility put up for sale by its parent Scottish Power Plc earlier this year, a 
trade magazine reported on Friday. 
Utility Week said British gas and homes services retailer Centrica had teamed 
up with French utility Vivendi Environnement , which already owns UK water 
assets, ""to consider a bid"".
But it cited unnamed sources saying the German-owned investment bank WestLB 
Panmure, which was behind a management buyout of Southern Water's neighbour 
Mid Kent Water earlier this year, had ""emerged as front-runner in the past 
week"". 
ENEL has said it is interested, and according to Reuters' industry sources 
Scottish Power's floor price is 1.7 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) excluding 
any attached debt. 
Scottish Power said in March the business was for sale. 
It needs the cash to help fund its own plans for expansion in the United 
States, where industry sources say it has held talks on buying Portland 
General, a power utility owned by Enron Corp , which neighbours the UK 
group's own PacifiCorp arm.

DPC not to re-start work on Phase II work

Copyright (c) Business Standard

Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) today said that Enron Corp chairman 
Kenneth Lay during his meetings with the Centre and the Maharashtra 
government had not agreed to any proposal to complete the construction of 
phase-II of the power project. 
""Dabhol Power Company believes that a decision to recommence construction 
cannot be made unless various issues relating to the project are completely 
resolved,"" DPC said in a statement.
It said that any discussion that Lay had on recommending construction of 
phase-II was in the context of the current uncertainties surrounding the 
project. 
DPC said that contractors working on the project resorted to termination due 
to non-payment of their dues as lenders had stopped disbursing funds. 
""This decision was taken as a result of continuing defaults by MSEB 
(Maharashtra State Electricity Board), including MSEB's repudiation of the 
PPA, their failure to pay outstanding invoices and their stated unwillingness 
to accept phase-II power, as well as failure of the government guarantors to 
honour their payment guarantees,"" said the statement. 
It added that the situation had not changed.

California Power Bills Exceed Refunds, Judge Says (Update4)

     (Adds legislator comment in sixth paragraph, details from
judge in 11th paragraph, negotiator comment in 12th paragraph.)

     Washington, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- California's debts to
power sellers for electricity purchases exceed any refund the
state can claim for alleged overcharging, a judge overseeing
settlement talks said in a report to federal regulators.
     California and its utilities may be owed more than $1 billion
on claims generators overcharged them, Administrative Law Judge
Curtis Wagner wrote in a report to the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission. California alleges power sellers like Duke Energy
Corp., Enron Corp. illegally inflated prices by $8.9 billion.
     ``While there are vast sums due for overcharges, there are
even larger amounts owed to energy sellers'' by California and its
utilities, Wagner wrote. He said the state is owed ``hundreds of
millions of dollars, probably more than a billion dollars.''
     The decision strengthens the generators' claim that the
state's request for billions isn't supported by the facts. Energy
companies have offered a total of $716 million in refunds to the
state, Wagner said.
     FERC-ordered negotiations between the state and the energy
sellers broke down without an agreement this week. FERC will
decide on the size of refunds within 60 days. California Governor
Gray Davis has said the state will sue if it does not receive the
refunds it demanded.
     ``I find it unlikely that someone will not be unhappy enough
to go to court,'' said State Senator Debra Bowen, a Democrat from
Los Angeles. ``There's too much money at stake.''

                         Wagner's Report

     FERC will use Wagner's report to calculate the size of any
refunds. California could receive refunds in the form of credit
against power-buying debts. In his report, Wagner didn't say how
much the state and its utilities owe to power companies.
     ``Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is
due the seller? The chief judge thinks not,'' wrote Wagner, who is
FERC's chief administrative law judge.
     Wagner provided suggestions to the FERC commissioners on how
to set any refunds. He urged that they calculate potential
overcharges beginning October 2000. California had urged the
settlement be figured from May 2000.
     Davis criticized that decision, calling it ``a $3 billion
free gouge for the generators'' in a statement released by his
office.
     The judge said California had rejected a settlement offer he
made during the talks. He did not say what that settlement offer
was. He said California would not budge from its initial demand.
He also said California did not provide him some of the background
information he requested until this week.
     ``If we had more time we might have been able to respond more
quickly, but we did the best we could,'' said Michael Kahn,
chairman of the Independent System Operator, the state's electric
grid manager. He led the state delegation.

                    Heart of Dispute

     At the heart of the dispute are federal regulations that
require power sellers to charge only those rates deemed by federal
regulators to be ``just and reasonable.'' FERC had price caps in
place when some of the disputed power purchases were made.
     Energy companies claim that rising natural-gas prices and a
lack of adequate supply pushed prices up. The state accuses the
companies reaping unreasonable profits.
     Davis has made attacks on power generators a staple of his
response to the energy crisis, and has accused them of gouging the
state in dozens of speeches since January. He said that if the
state isn't paid $8.9 billion, it would sue for up to $20 billion.
     Energy executives accuse Davis and California political
leaders of attempting to scapegoat the energy companies for a
failed deregulation plan that led to soaring wholesale prices last
year. The state's largest two utilities can't pay for their power.
     ``It's pretty clear that the state has no particular interest
in resolving this,'' Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling said
in an interview with Bloomberg News. ``It makes for good political
fodder, and so I think they'll spend a lot of time making a lot of
noise about it.''
     Several other energy companies praised the judge's
recommendations.
     ``We agree with the judge's position that the $8.9 billion
refund number is totally unsubstantiated,'' Duke Energy Corp.
spokesman Tom Williams said.
     PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison
International's Southern California Edison, the state's largest
investor-owned utilities, ran up more than $14 billion in debt
buying electricity last year. The state stepped in and began
buying power for them in January, and has spent more than $7
billion.




California Governor Casts Blame for Crisis, to His Benefit
2001-07-13 03:03 (New York)

California Governor Casts Blame for Crisis, to His Benefit

     San Francisco, July 13 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor
Gray Davis's popularity is bouncing back, and pollsters credit the
Democratic lawmaker's campaign to blame the state's energy
problems on out-of-state power companies.
     Davis has criticized Duke Energy Corp., Enron Corp. and other
power sellers as price gougers since January. This week, Davis
used a power-plant opening as a platform to claim that energy
sellers are ``bleeding us dry.'' The Democratic state attorney
general and Democratic-controlled state Senate are investigating
the firms for market manipulation.
     The governor is winning support because of his attacks. A Los
Angeles Times poll in June showed that 86 percent of Californians
believed power generators distorted prices. Davis's approval
rating rose to 52 percent of registered voters in June, from 46
percent in early April, his lowest since being elected in 1998,
his pollster, Paul Maslin, found.
     ``Gray Davis is very good at licking his fingers and seeing
which way the political winds blow,'' said Bruce Cain, a political
science professor at the University of California at Berkeley.
``And he's found good villains.''

                    Outlook for Settlement

     The politics may make it harder for the state to reach a
settlement with energy companies for claims they overcharged the
state by $8.9 billion, analysts say. A federal judge overseeing
settlement talks said the state is owed far less. Davis says the
state will sue for $18 billion if its demands aren't met.
     ``There is no way you are going to get any kind of agreement
from someone making such audacious claims,'' said Donato Eassey,
an energy analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. in Houston.
     The refunds may be secondary to Davis's effort to be re-
elected in 2002, a victory that political analysts say position
him as a contender for national office in 2004.
     ``He's in good shape going into 2002, and if he wins, there's
the inevitable speculation about whether he eyes a run for
president in 2004,'' Cain said.
     Just months ago, Davis's public approval ratings were at
their lowest point since he was elected, according to a Field
Institute poll in April.
     PG&E Corp.'s utility, the state's largest, was in bankruptcy.
Wholesale-power prices were rising, and millions of Californians
lost power in a string of blackouts caused by reduced power
reserves.

                         Governor Rebounds

     The governor was widely criticized for failing to act swiftly
to end the crisis. Now Davis seems to be recovering, analysts
said.
     While vilifying the power companies, the first-term governor
has also been spearheading the state's response to the energy
crisis. He has created a team to negotiate a financial rescue
package to save Edison International's Southern California Edison
utility from bankruptcy, started an $800 energy conservation drive
and pushed for more power plants to be built.
     The energy companies lashed back at Davis this week. A
spokesman for Enron Corp., the world's largest energy trader,
accused Davis and California leaders of conducting a political
``witch hunt.''
     ``The last thing they want to do is take responsibility for
the problem they created,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.
``They set about looking for the biggest villains.''
     Enron filed suit against a California state Senate committee
investigating allegations of market manipulation, accusing the
panel and its Democratic chairman in a letter of seeking a
``scapegoat'' for a failed deregulation law.

                   Plotting his Response

     Davis began plotting his response to the crisis almost
immediately after it became public in January, said Garry South,
his chief political strategist. Step one, Davis aides said, was to
blame the energy companies that were profiting from the state's
woes. Davis targeted a half-dozen companies. In addition to Enron
and Duke, Mirant Corp., Reliant Energy Inc., and Williams Cos.
were placed in the crosshairs.
     ``There was a group of perpetrators from out of state
manipulating this system and screwing consumers,'' South said.
``We had to explain how this thing happened.''
     Republicans criticize Davis for inaction on the crisis, while
acknowledging he is favored to win re-election going into next
year's campaign.
     He leads three potential rivals -- Secretary of State Bill
Jones, banker William Simon, the son of former Treasury Secretary
William Simon, and former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan,
according to the Times poll of 1,541 state residents conducted
June 23-26.
     ``He will be the favorite,'' said Rob Stutzman, a consultant
for the California Republican Party.

                         Worries Ahead

     Davis still has worries as the state struggles to address the
energy crisis, analysts say.
     PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy in
April. Edison International's Southern California Edison, the No.
2 utility, is struggling to overcome legislative opposition to the
financial-rescue package negotiated by Davis.
     Davis may be blamed, analysts say, if the state Legislature
refuses to ratify the rescue plan for Edison and the utility files
for bankruptcy. Republicans and many Democrats in the Legislature
oppose the agreement, known as a memorandum of understanding.
     ``The MOU's dead, and the likely scenario is for the utility
is to go into bankruptcy,'' said Peter Navarro, an associate
professor of economics and public management at the University of
California at Irvine.
     California voters may receive unpleasant reminders of the
crisis all summer. The state has already suffered through six days
of rolling blackouts, and more are predicted.
     ``As soon as the lights go out, it's Gray's fault,'' Navarro
said."

Hello Team,

I hope that everyone had a wonderful and restful holiday season.  

Down to business:  The University Affairs group is putting together a tiger 
team of students to do a project for Enron.  Those students will be in town 
on January 18th and will be having dinner at Churrasco's that night.  I think 
it would be a great opportunity for some of the Wharton alum to come out and 
meet the participants, talk about Enron and eat some good food.  :-)  If you 
are interested in participating please RSVP to me via email or at extension 
53214 no later than 1/5/01.  

Thank you and hope to see you soon,

Kristin Gandy

		 Subject: ENA v. Triad


Andy,

This is basically a collection action for about $1,800,000 of unpaid spot gas 
sales against Triad, a very small company whose address (or at least one 
address) is in Columbus, Maryland.   The unpaid sales deals began around 
February of 2000.  All the deals were made over the phone by the trader, and 
then confirmed with ENA's spot gas sales forms (""confirms"").  Per ENA's usual 
custom and practice, neither ENA nor Triad signed the confirms, although 
there are signature lines.  ENA scheduled the gas due for all of these 
deals.  Triad paid off some other deals, but has since stopped sending us any 
money.  I am told that the deals that are unpaid began in late February 
2000.  Triad's principal, Sherwood Purnell, has apparently admitted in a 
recorded telephone conference that he would pay us.  Our information is that 
Triad is financially unable to pay us or anyone else.

Per the mandatory arbitration language in the confirms, we have sent an 
arbitration demand to Triad.  Triad did not respond.  The AAA has sent out a 
list of arbitrators from which the parties are to make selections by February 
7.  I have called a telephone number which gives a recording for Triad and an 
extension for Purnell, and left a message that I want to discuss the case.  
This was on Monday.  I have also had  Becky, my legal assistant, call up 
Triad's registered agent for service of process, although the Maryland 
secretary of state's office shows that Triad is no longer in good standing.  
The person whose name is listed as the registered agent answered and told 
Becky (a) he was still the right party to receive service of process and (b) 
he was ""aware of us"".  This leads me to believe that the address that we have 
been using is a good address.  We did get someone to sign for documents that 
we sent to that address.  

What I don't want to do, however,  is go all the way through arbitration, get 
a default judgment, then, when we try to enforce it, have Triad complain that 
we sent the demand and the pleadings to the wrong address.

My plan is to ask the AAA for a fifteen-day extension of time within which to 
send our demand and other relevant pleadings to the registered agent and any 
other address that looks viable, by Federal Express or certified mail, so 
that we get a receipt.  So long as we get the registered agent to sign for 
these things, I feel a lot more comfortable about proceeding.   Giving Triad 
an extension of time to answer also makes us look good. 

Parenthetically, unfortunately, given Triad's attitude, I think it likely 
that after we get an arbitration award, Triad will choose not to abide by it 
until, at a minimum, we file a lawsuit in Maryland to have the award 
enforced.  I don't see a way around that problem.

Let me know if it is okay to ask for the extension of time.

Britt

Thanks.

Britt

We have length at PV all day on Sunday, and light load on Monday.  That is HE 
2-24 MST on Sunday, and HE1-6,23,24 on Monday.  The energy is parked with PNM 
at PV.  The cost is $125.  We are long in position manager.  Please route the 
sale to buy/resale #566175, and then make the sale under the ST-WBOM book.  
There is no HE 3 in Pacific time.  This may require some creativity on your 
part.   Please call me with any questions and good luck!

I have some questions and coments.

WHY DOES ENRON FEEL THE NEED TO FILE SEPARATELY? We can't we file with ARM?

WHY DO WE WANT THE DISCUSSION NARROWED TO SDG&E ONLY?  I can see pros and 
cons of each way.

I DO NOT SEE HOW WE CAN SUPPORT PRICE CAPS.....If we could not support them 
on the wholesale side, how can we support them on the retail side?  Doesn't 
it kill the ESP business?  Doesn't it eliminate any benefits of dereulation?  
If we support them, we are givibng in to the unjustified terrorism that is 
taking place in CA.  We don't even now whrer the monry is coming from.  What 
if they expect to get it from us.  Hey, can we sue -- we can't if we SUPPORT 
price caps.

WE MUST STICK WITH THE PRINCIPLES WE'VE FOUGHT FOR ALL THESE YEARS -- SOME 
THINGS ARE JUST  WORTH FIGHTNG FOR.
I recommend opposition of the price caps -- the resukt of the knee=jerk, 
weekly about -face by the CPUC which cannot possibly be considered to be 
reasoned decision making

Unless we receive comments by 9 a.m. p.d.t. Monday, August 14, this will be 
Enron's pre-hearing conference comments relative to the Investigation opened 
by the Commission.  These comments will be filed Monday.  Please make sure 
Bruno is copied on your comments.

NOTE:  

Rather than opposing a cap for small consumers, which I believe is imminent, 
I would prefer to advocate that it apply only to small consumers, under 20 
kW, and only for a limited period of time.  I would prefer to argue that the 
cap should not apply to larger consumers, who  already have access to market 
solutions to insulate them from market volatility.

PLEASE LET ME KNOW ASAP IF WE CANNOT SUPPORT THIS POSITION.

Dan, only one addition to PHC.  Will advise on filing.

After reviewing Mona's draft and making a few other cleanup changes, the 
attached proposed final draft is attached for your review.

Since Mona and I are both on vacation, Bruno will coordinate with Michelle 
Dangott of my office to finalize the filing on Monday.  Bruno, if you have 
any last minute changes, please call Michelle at (818) 596-2216.  Remember it 
has to be finalized by no later than 10 or so Monday morning, so we can do 
the final duplicating and have the filing couriered to the CPUC in the midst 
of the traffic disruption caused by the Democratic convention.

My thanks to all!

Subject: 4Q Earnings from ENA Principal Investments

We have now refined our initial estimates for potential 4Q fair value 
earnings on each of our portfolio investments:

Dais-Analytic ($8.27 MM) - DAC has signed an agreement with Lucky Goldstar of 
Korea which includes a $5 MM minority equity investment at a pre-money 
valuation equal to $147.9 MM.  The agreement has been signed, is legally 
binding, can not be unilaterally terminated by LG and transfer of money will 
happen as soon as LG receives Korean central bank approval.  (Note:  We could 
take an additional $3.55 MM gain, or $11.8 MM aggregate, if we chose to 
exercise our option to invest $4.5 MM in DAC prior to year end)

Encorp ($14.1 MM) - Encorp has received a term sheet from Ballentine Capital 
which values the company at $100 MM pre-money.  Beacon Capital and Goldman 
Sachs have both passed on making an investment at $100 MM.  Given current 
market conditions, we believe a pre-money valuation of $90 MM is more 
realistic and closer to what Ballentine will ultimately do the deal at.  The 
$14.1 MM figure corresponds to a valuation of $90 MM.   

Solo Energy ($1.5 MM) - the downturn in the equity markets has had its effect 
on Solo's fund raising.  Chase H&Q has solicited a number of investors in the 
market, including Beacon, Perseus, Stephens (Little Rock) and Ballentine and 
all are interested and reviewing.  Charlie's sense is that the term sheets 
that we should receive by year end will be at a valuation lower than the $80 
MM that H&Q has been advertising to the company (and us).  The $1.5 MM figure 
corresponds to a pre-money valuation of $60 MM, which we view as more 
realistic.

Metering Technology Corp. ($1.0 MM) - Aqua International Partners has agreed 
to invest $15 MM at a pre-money valuation of $45 MM.  

Power Systems Mfg LLC ($0.72 MM) - the principals of PSM have agreed to sell 
the company to Calpine for $43 MM, making our warrant worth $1.72 MM.  Enron 
will receive cash for the warrant upon closing of the deal.  PSM's proceeds 
will be paid out over a 2-3 year period.

Utiliquest - we learned in November that Utiliquest had lost its bid to 
retain the Atlanta area locating business of BellSouth, Atlanta Gas & Light, 
Metromedia (Cable TV) and Georgia Power.  This was obviously disappointing to 
us - and symptomatic of the performance which led me to replace Utiliquest's 
CEO just prior to the award of Atlanta bid (which went to STS, a subsidiary 
of Dycom).  The initial indication from the company was that - while Atlanta 
represented $20 MM in revenues (roughly 20% of total revenues) - there would 
be a proportionately smaller change in EBITDA and the bottom line.  After 
further analysis - conducted in connection with our planned divestiture - we 
have determined that there will likely be a $2-3 MM reduction in EBITDA for 
2000.  Our anticipated EBITDA exit multiple is 6-7x 2000 figures.  I need to 
discuss a revaluation of Utiliquest in more detail with Kevin, Wes Colwell 
and Andrea Reed.

Total comes to $25.6 MM plus whatever we determine is achievable on 
Utiliquest. 

Please call if you have any questions.

1.  No.  We won't do that until we think we have to.
2.  Not entirely, they have to meet certain more restrictive tests depending on how they are organized (i.e. how sophisticated are the investors).  A fund group like Fidelity that allows my Mom to invest has to have $1,000,000,000 in assets.  A true hedge fund that limits its investors to those meeting certain sophistication requirements only needs $100,000,000 in total assets.
3. Yes
4. Only if we become ""regulated.""  Currently we still maintain that we are a one-to-many site and are not yet subject to these rules.

OK - so based on this document:

1) Are we registered with the CFTC?
2) Are we prohibited from transacting with hedge funds (""investment company"")?
3) Are the ""exemption conditions"" with which the facility must comply just the conditions listed in the document?
4) Could you clarify: Do the conditions described in the document apply to us now, or only if we become ""regulated""?


As per our conversation, I understand that FX is subject to even less stringent requirements than our current commodities are. 

Thanks,

Dave

Attached is a brief outline of the requirements for electronic trading facilities for transactions in exempt commodities.  Exempt commodities are all commodities other than financial commodities (e.g. interest rates, currencies, securities) and agricultural commodities.

Yeah, just think of the lines we could use:

Hey baby, wanna come out and help me pitch my tent?
Your sleeping bag or mine?
Hey baby, lets go camping.  I'll supply the pork and beans.

I have received your E-Mail .   

Steve, 

I have likewise done alot of reflecting about our dinner and the events that 
followed.  As of now I have no plans to do business with Natsourse.  You need 
to also be aware that this will include Gulf Coast Basis and Gas Dailys.


Thank You"

RE:
POSITION ADJUSTMENT DEADLINES FOR THE JULY 2001 METAL AND ENERGY CONTRACTS 
[NYMEX RULE 9.04(P) AND COMEX RULE 4.37(A)]

______________________________________________________________________________

 As a reminder, position adjustments for both NYMEX and COMEX Division metals 
contracts are prohibited beginning on the tenth business day prior to the 
first business day of the delivery month, and throughout the delivery month.  
Therefore, all position adjustments of concurrent futures positions for the 
July 2001 metals contracts must be completed prior to June 18, 2001.

 Additionally, position adjustments of concurrent futures positions for NYMEX 
energy contracts are not permitted during the last three trading days of the 
respective contracts.  Rules 9.04(P) and 4.37(A) are attached.

 If you have any questions concerning this matter, please contact Nick Galati 
at (212) 299-2920, Nick Falcone at (212) 299-2919, or Bonnie Yurga at (212) 
299-2879.


NYMEX RULE 9.04 - CLEARING PROCEDURE

(P) Concurrent Futures Positions

(1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may not 
be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other bookkeeping 
procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor transactions in 
accordance with Exchange Rules. Provided, however, that a clearing member 
will be exempt from this requirement if: (I) one side of the concurrent 
position is established the business day prior to the date that the offset 
memoranda are filed with the Clearing House; (II) a clearing member filing 
such offset memoranda can satisfy the Exchange at its request that the delay 
in effecting the offset is attributed to an error in the filing of its 
clearing sheets; and (III) by 10:30 a.m. on the same date that a clearing 
member files such offset memoranda, the clearing member also files with the 
clearing house an updated and accurate Long Open Interest Report.

(2) For the purposes of this Rule 9.04(P), the current delivery month for 
energy futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the third 
business day, prior to termination of the respective futures contract, 
including the termination date. The current delivery month in platinum and 
palladium commences on the tenth (10th) business day prior to the first 
business day of the delivery month.

COMEX RULE 4.37A - CONCURRENT FUTURES POSITIONS

(1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may not 
be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other bookkeeping 
procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor transactions in 
accordance with Exchange Rules. Provided, however, that a clearing member 
will be exempt from this requirement if one side of the concurrent position 
is established the business day prior to the date that the open positions are 
filed with the Clearing House.

(2) For the purposes of this Rule 4.37A, the current delivery month for 
metals futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the tenth (10th) 
business day, prior to the first business day of the delivery month.
The current delivery month for Eurotop futures commences on the open of 
trading on the tenth (10th) business day prior to the termination of the 
respective futures contract, including the termination date.

Bob,

I am writing to you to confirm my voice-mail message regarding the SEC deposition.
I decided that I don't really  need a counsel to assist me at my deposition before
the Commission. I may retain a lawyer of my own choice to give me general 
advice about the procedures and I shall send you the bill for reimbursement
of expenses. 

My decision should not be interpreted as a statement about Mr. Levy's qualifications.
I found him to be an exceptionally competent lawyer. My only regret is that I shall not be given
an opportunity to spend more time with him and learn from his experience. 

You may recall that  I have indicated to you a few weeks ago that my intention was to waive my
right to a counsel.  This was before I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Levy in person. 

I am sending you the copy of my fax to the SEC as an attachment to a separate message.

Subject: My resume



Dear Vince,

Attached please find an updated resume of mine.

I have been continuing my research in the area of pricing, risk management
and asset management of power industry.  It seems to me that the framework I
have been working on does allow addressing some fundamental issues and
allows describing the salient features of power markets.  I feel a brief
info may inform you what have I been up to.

Conceptually speaking, my approach relies on the understudying that the
absence of cash and carry implies non-hedgibility of the most fundamental
building blocks of power market - forward contracts of hourly duration.
This clearly demands a risk premium embedded in power prices.  I have been
able to develop a machinery to capture this risk premium, and calculate its
impact on pricing of other products.  In particular, the method allows
consistent generation of hourly forward curve (per each geographic region),
hence generation of forward curves of longer duration.  It provides us not
only with forward curves, but also their physical (not risk-neutral)
distribution.  It also allows one to analyze the sensitivity of the forward
curve with respect to the volumetric risk.  As a fundamental  input ,  I
consider the ratio of properly compounded generation output (load) and the
corresponding maximum available generation supply.  The first one is well
observable and forecastable due to its stationarity.  The second one  is
defined by the first one and the generation and transmission profile of the
region.  Much of the required information is in the public domain.

The market price of risk incorporated in the model depends on this ratio and
the calendar time.  This time dependence of the market price of risk allows
capturing of the dynamics of the returns per unit risk over time, and its
dependence on the ratio mentioned above reflects the intuition and the
reality that closer the demand to the maximum available supply higher
compensation do the investors expect.

I have also realized that the transmission related factors may be
incorporated into this framework in a very consistent and robust manner.

This approach also allows quantification of the margins as a stochastic
process dependent on the volumetric factors, among other things.  It allows
posing and solving the problem of maximization of the margins while keeping
their variance under control in a very elegant and robust way.

I have developed the first version of mathematical tools and prototype
software reflecting all these issues.  My inability to complete this program
has been resulted from the severe instability, lack of access and the cash
flow problems I have experienced in the last few years.  I have also
understood that programs of this magnitude cannot be finished from the
""grandpa's garage.""

Nevertheless, I think I have developed a very systematic and robust
understanding and methodology, and at least, I have convinced myself that
this approach leads to a comprehensive system.

With all this said, I don't want to make an impression of a stiff person,
who has his agenda and under any circumstances is willing to push it
forward.  I have always been very flexible, and in my consulting experience,
I have always accommodated the needs and wishes on my clients.  In my short
period of employment with Altra I have been very ethical, I have played by
the rules, I have done whatever I have been asked to do, and have been a
team player.  The reasons they have asked me to resign have nothing to do
with me personally.  They have been respectful to me, they have valued me as
capable person, but have found that given the direction of the company
(which has become self-evident with the consequent developments), ""further
Altra goes, further I will be frustrated with where they go.""  It was almost
formulated that it is better for me to separate from Altra as soon as I can.
As an evidence of appreciation, they have continued paying me as of today,
something that they have not done for some others, but it is coming to its
end, too.  I am bringing this up just to reiterate that my separation from
Altra has had nothing to do with me or my entrepreneurial working style vs.
corporate style, etc.  I have no doubts that I can function equally well in
either environment.

I wish that your presentation goes well with your new superior, and that my
joining Enron becomes a possibility.

Martin

I have identified the additional HPLC wellhead purchases and have made 
corrections to the interconnect tickets accordingly.  Jackie is still having 
difficulty identifying all the wellhead purchase.  We feel there are at least 
6 meters flowing a total of appox. 7000 a day that are not showing up on a 
HPLC purchase or a HPLR transport.  I believe she has given you this 
information and will await instructions or for the purchases to be input 
reflecting the proper Enron Entity purchasing these volumes.

We have worked very hard on this issue and I apologize that it has not yet 
been entirely corrected."

Worth your time. Best, Stocky



FRIENDHSIP WEEK

If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same, it
would look something like the following: there would be:

57 asians
21 europeans
14 from the western hemisphere, both north and south
8  africans

52 would be female
48 would be male

70 would be non-white
30 would be white
70 would be non-christian
30 would be christian
89 would be heterosexual
11 would be homosexual
6  people would possess 59% of the entire world's wealth and all 6 be
from  the United States.
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
1  would be near death
1  would be near birth
1  (yes, only 1) would have a college education
1  would own a computer

When one considers our world from such a compressed perspective, the
need for acceptance, understanding and education becomes glaringly
apparent.

The following is also something to ponder...

If you woke up this morning with more health than illness...you are
more blessed than the million who will not survive this week. If you have
never experienced the danger of battle, the loneliness of imprisonment, the
agony of torture, or the pangs of starvation you are ahead of 500 million
people in the world.

If you can attend a church meeting without fear of harassment,
arrest, torture, or death...you are more blessed than three billion people
in
the world.

If you have food in the refrigerator, clothes on your back, a roof
overhead and a place to sleep...you are richer than 75% of this
world.

If you have money in the bank, in your wallet, and spare change in a
dish someplace ... you are among the top 8% of the world's wealthy.

If your parents are still alive and still married ... you are very
rare.

If you can read this message, you just received a double blessing in
that someone was thinking of you, and furthermore, you are more blessed
than over two billion people in the world that cannot read at all.

Someone once said:  what goes around comes around.

Work  like you don't need the money.
Love  like you've never been hurt.
Dance like nobody's watching.
Sing  like nobody's listening.
Live  like it's heaven on earth.

It's national friendship week. Send this to everyone you consider a
friend. Pass this on, and brighten someone's day. Nothing will happen
if you do not decide to pass it along. the only thing that will happen,
if you do pass it on, is that someone might smile because of you.

Subject:	RE: Replacement Cost Values

The 2001 annual allocated premium for these assets for property insurance is $670,000 based upon ENA's 2001 reported value of approximately $470,000,000.  The pro-rata credit for 7 months, assuming a 5-31-01 sale date, would be $390,833.  

Underwriters require an update of values and exposures annually at renewal. Gathering these values within Enron normally requires 30 to 45 days.  We use these same values in the allocation system. Unless the value change is significant, the actual cost of insurance to the outside insurers will not change  Once you complete your entire study of replacement cost values, we can discuss whether approaching underwriters is warranted.

 If we internally adjust your allocation mid-year, we must move the premium that we take away from you to the other participants in the program.  As you know, the remainder of Enron did not stand still while you sold Bammel.  We have not tried this before, however, I suspect if approached with the additional premium as a result reducing ENA's allocation, all the other operating entities would want to re-submit their revised  values as well and we would find ourselves in a constant state of adjustment.  In view of the time required, this is neither practical nor cost effective for Enron.  In view of the relatively small numbers, I doubt that Corp. would entertain this proposition either, however, we can approach them if you wish.

Please let me know how much of the 2000 insurance premium is being allocated to the approx. $700MM of HPL assets.  This charge is effectively ""a cost of capital"" and should be re-allocated to other groups with insured assets or should remain at Corp.

Regards,
Brian

Subject:	RE: Replacement Cost Values

Brian:

This insurance is purchased on a portfolio basis with payment to underwriters at inception of the coverage. Values are adjusted annually at renewal. The premiums are allocated to the participating entities as part of the budget process and insignificant additions and deletions of assets do not normally result in premiums additions or refunds.  In the event that we discontinue premiums to North America for HLP, we have no mechanism to allocate that premium to the other assets that continue to be insured. In the event of a significant divestiture, underwriters may consider a refund, however, the values discussed below would not likely be significant when compared to Enron's values as a whole. Additionally, Enron's adverse loss experience affects the underwriters ability to return premium for small divestitures. 

At renewal, 4/01/02, North America's revised property values will be declared to underwriters as part of Enron's overall values and your premium allocation will adjust depending upon your values and loss experience as compared to the rest of Enron. 

Regards,

Paul

Please confirm that ENA will not bear any insurance costs for the HPL assets for the second half of 2001 and the balance of years going forward?  If this is not the case, then we need to meet and discuss why this is not the case.

Thanks,
Brian

Paul
In addition to the 188,371,296 property value for Bammel Lease that you mentioned below there was also a value on your spreadsheet for Bammel Gas Storage of 267,000,000.  Requirements to insure both of these amounts should be with AEP not Enron and thus the 2002 Plan Premium Allocations of $754,096 on the Bammel Gas Storage 267,000,000 value and $924,433 on the Bammel Lease value of 188,371,296 should not be needed.  

Jackie
Please remove these amounts from the ENA-HPL 2002 Plan.

Jim:
As discussed for the purposes of the 2002 Insurance Budget, we will delete the Bammel Lease (1409) property values of $188,371,296. We will advise the insurers effective this past June to delete these assets and will attempt to receive a refund. However, as respects asset divestitures, insurers have not been inclined in the past to refund premiums for comparatively small divestitures in view of our adverse loss experience. However, if we are successful in receiving a credit, we will refund the premium.

I will discuss with Karen and Brian the other remaining assets.

Great to see you guys, and despite all the excitement, it was alot of fun.  
Hope that you made it back safely.  Couple of things:

I'd like to talk to several vineyard consultants, so if it ain't too much 
trouble, and you've got a name, I'd love to check around.
Can I order two cases of coastal zin?
What about the champagne?  How much per magnum is it?

Best,

Subject: confidential employee information-dutch quigley

John,
As we discussed earlier, ENA HR is working with the A/A program to develop a 
process for placing sr. spec into associate titles.  Unfortunately, that 
process has not been finalized and as such, Dutch is not yet an associate.  
Ted is finalizing the process this week and it will likely require Dutch to 
interview with 4 other commercial managers outside of ENA.  

Additionally, there are two other sr. spec. on the gas trading floor in 
similar situations and we will be discussing them at a promotion meeting to 
be held the first week of Jan.  I would like to handle all of these 
consistently and had planned to include Dutch's promotion in this 
discussion.  I would recommend that we hold on a title change for Dutch until 
after this meeting and manage it through the promotions process.

Per the message attached below, Dutch believes he has already received the 
title change.  Please clarify the situation with him at your earliest 
convenience.  If you need my assistance with this please let me know.   I 
apologize if there was any confusion from our previous discussions.  Please 
contact me with any questions/concerns.

Subject: New Spreadsheet input


Burton,
The following spreadsheets were still loaded from the ng_directory. Rock did 
call me saying that some pipe option spreadsheets were not loading through 
the new process and when I checked it seemed like a network problem and asked 
him to run it again and it seemed to be OK.

With the new process, there is no need for double quotes around the curve 
code and counterparty code columns anymore. This has been automatically taken 
care of since we process from the spreadsheet itself. This was the original 
problem around the pipe option spreadsheets which we discovered yesterday and 
the reason why the numbers did not match between the old and new processes.

I also noticed that INTRA-NORTHEAST-PHY was officialised 4 times - 2 times in 
a row in quick succcession.

I would like Rock or Robin to load these spreadsheets once again during the 
day with Virendra or me as early as possible. We have been consistently been 
able to load these into the test data bases.

The ng spreadsheet also has a quoted price curve code. It should not take any 
time to convert these spreadsheets over.

The ft_northwest sheet seems to be fine - just that it was put into the ng 
directory. Please advise them not to use this directory anymore. Any NT based 
directory will give much better response.

The surprises are the rll and the plastics text files. I thought these were 
the first to go the new spreadsheet format.

Brian Gillis was able to load his spreadsheets successfully through terminal 
server from Calgary yesterday.

Regards,
Ramesh

The above meter is non-allocatable and was off system, actuals at meter #8693.

Revision - According to measurement, there is flow of 7,394 in 8/98, however, 
there is nothing to indicate this is gas that was received on HPL in OSS.   I 
checked MIPs and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate 
of 7,394 MMBTu.  

Daren is there a deal in CPR which may not have fed over to OSS?   I checked 
OSS for the whole year of 1998 and there are no other deals in OSS.  It does 
seem strange that this is the only month of flow.

Thanks, Stella

FYI - we will probably be asked what historical information is needed in our 
shop from a Logistics perspective. I would suggest asking the new CES 
employees to give us a list of what they know we would probably need to deal 
with historical questions on pipeline and customer physical imbalances as 
well as any other information that helps support some of the large customer 
and asset transactions. 

Have each of them put together a list that we can consolidate and forward to 
the IT folks. 

Thanks - Bob

The following summarizes the decisions made during our  user & IT joint 
meeting today regarding the handling of CES historical data.

A.  Bryce Baxter will coordinate with all user groups to identify CES reports 
that need to be actually printed as hard copy or transfered to files that 
will be accessed               via the Electronic Document Management system.
B.  Jeff Peoples will be working with Bryce Baxter to produce reports using 
CES system via ISDN line at Enron building - this will continue to be part of 
his duty until  the job is done (Jeff joined ENA as a member of Sitara group).
C.  Larry Daze will be working with Jeff Peoples and Bryce Baxter to ensure 
all reports are loaded on our EDMS with proper indexing.
D.  No need for manupulating CES history data is necessary  (i.e. downloading 
on spreadsheets).  Therefore, no data will be kept on the disk other than 
EDMS.

Max, congrats on the Decero PPA - we need to wrestle up another 100 to 200 
MW.  This should be a priority given the profit potential of this deal as per 
Oz and Doug (+50M in 2000).  Is there an ability to let Sabine or Irvin run 
with Vitro and get your attention on this item asap.  I know that the 
Monterrey project is eating into your time.  Do we need to augment your 
resources?

On a different note, the current Monterrey control budget is showing a $5.3M 
negative variance from the original control budget.  Is this accurate?  Does 
this reduce the profitability or is it absorbed by the PPA's?

Regards
Delainey"

I know you would not bid the entire 1000Mwe, we are trying to come up with a proxy to assist in the bid, I am also trying to get you in with Mr.Green and the 150-200Mwe indicative would be great. I need it by Wednesday (2/13/02).

I'll get back with you on this within a couple of days.   Do you want an indicative bid for 7x24 bus-bar energy (2, 5 and 10 years).   We would not bid on the entire 1000 MW - maybe 150-200 MW.

I know you are quite busy but I wonder if you could get your lead trader to look the following forecast for NEEPOOL. This may result in you getting the lead for a large block of the power so be conservative but have enough in there so it is a win win if you know what I mean.
 
Have him fill in what he can. The client will be looking long 10 year, with maybe a series of 2 and 5 year deals. Should be putting out around 500 to 700 Mwe.
 
Do not disclose the plant eh ?

On the call on Friday, Linda asked if we could distribute materials 
developed/used recently in California regarding the crisis and solutions to 
try to resolve it.  Attached are:

A ""backgrounder"" provided to the business leaders that Ken Lay met with last 
week
A power point presentation that is a ""higher level"" discussion of the more 
detailed ""backgrounder.""

If I missed anyone, please forward along.  If anyone has any questions, give 
me a call at 415.782.7822.

Best,
Jeff

Chris and Heather,

  I wanted to let you all know that I have added some replacement deals to the ST CA and ST W Hourly books that we spoke about yesterday.  Below is an explanation of why, and I have listed the old deals and the replacement deals......	

ST W Services sold a position to the ST CA book and ST ST W Hrly desks, but the energy didn't flow due to a scheduled outage.  Since the energy didn't flow, the desks entered some sales to WHEELABRATOR to sell back the energy that didn't flow.  This sale should have been to the ST W Services book to sell back the position, not to WHEELABRATOR.  I zero'd out the sales to WHEELABRATOR and entered intra-desk annuities.  Please see below:

Sunday 6-17-01 

 RT old deal : 650578.1
RT new deal: PA 679980 SA 679973

ST CA old deal: 650607.1
ST CA new deal: SA 679991 PA 679995

Monday 6-18-01

RT old deal: 650638.1 & 652580.1
new deal: SA 678497.1 PA 678498.1

ST CA old deal: 651968.1
new deal: SA 678495 and PA 678496"

If you have not yet volunteered, we still need people and would really appreciate your help.  Below is some information about the project we will be working on.  I will send more details to the definite volunteers.  

If we can't have your time, we would still like to borrow your tools.  Also, we are collecting food and baked goods to take to this man, who's only food is from Meals on Wheels (healthy stuff).

I look forward to your responses letting me know how you'll be able to help.  If you have questions, please call me at 3-0322.

Subject:	Day of Caring - 5719 Ettrick, Aug 8, 2001

Below is information about the house you will be volunteering at on Wednesday, August 8th.  Please send me a list of all the AA volunteers, as well as the ones who will be staying all day.

This house is in need of outside repairs.  Mr. Elvin Rayes is an older man and lives there alone.  He is a veteran and is very proud and doesn't want to accept charity.  However, he is going to let us help him with the outside.  He was very nice when I met him on Sunday and I told him that all the people coming over to help were excited they didn't have to go to work for the day.  This made it seem like we were doing more of a favor for ourselves versus for him.  He liked that.  This house really needs a lot of TLC

I would suggest everyone wear old clothes they don't mind painting in and their GREEN United Way t-shirts (shorts are fine but jeans may be better for those who want to mow - this is Houston and it's summer).  Below is a safety note one site leader sent out to his team.  You may want to forward this to your AA volunteers.

Safety First!!!

Let's make sure we are all safe. We all want to go home just like we get there - no injuries!!
A few safety rules:

If you see someone working unsafe - either tell them, or tell me immediately (so I can tell them)!
Plan your work, and discuss it with your work crew.
Don't hurry, use common sense.
Use the right tool for the job
Be careful lifting, lift with your legs, not your back.  If item is heavy or bulky, get help! - Don't be macho.
Be sure to wear safety glass or goggles when appropriate (weed eating, power saws, grass mowing, etc).
Wear work gloves
Make sure ladders are secure, and either tied down or someone stabilizing the base.
Be aware of people around you and what they are doing.

Tasks

Here are the main tasks at the Ettrick house.  Once everyone gets out there, we can shift the work according to everyone's preference as long as the work gets done.  People may work on more than one task depending on progress, congestion, and what people would like to do.

Replace rotten outside trim boards
Replace garage door (rotten on bottom)
Trim trees with chainsaw - especially in the back yard
Replace soffit screening
Clean bathroom - 2 people
Yard work - trim hedges, mow and edge
Replace screen door
Caulk around the windows
Scrape old paint and paint outside
Replace window screens
Replace doorbell

Tools

Here is the list of tools.  Bring what you have and make sure to put your name on it with a permanent marker.  Please let me know if you are missing any tools and I will do my best to get them there.  It may be good for people that have tool boxes just to bring them if they can.  It always seems like there will be something they will need that isn't there.

5719 Ettrick	Lawnmower	1	
Houston, TX  77035	Edger	1	
	Chainsaw	1	
	Rakes	8

	Everyone should bring:	Gloves	
		Sunscreen	
		Bug spray	
		Jeans and long sleeve shirt at volunteers discretion	
		Wear clothes appropriate to paint	
		Disposable Camera if wanted	

 
Buses & Lunch 

A bus will leave for the morning shift at 8:15 AM and at 1:00 PM from the Enron building.  Box lunches will be provided at the Enron building in the lobby.  If you are working all day a lunch will be sent for you on the 1:00 PM bus.

Here is the link for mapquest:

If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to call me.  I will be at your site in the morning to kick everyone off!!  Let's have a fun day, help some people, and show the Enron spirit!!!

Vince,

Bryan has been unable to find anyone suitable to attend this symposium on 
Saturday, so has suggested I attend, which I am happy to do. My only 
reservation is that my knowledge of this area is very limited, so it is 
likely I would just be an observer, rather than a participant. Anyway just so 
that I am adequately prepared could you briefly describe our current 
relationship with this project, and also suggest any reading, like a magazine 
or paper, that would quickly aid my understanding of the topics to be 
discussed.

Many thanks,

Ben

Bryan,

I shall  call you later today when I have a chance to read the message from 
Ben.

I wanted to ask you for a favor (on a very short notice). We are talking to 
the Wharton School
about setting up a relationship with them and getting involved in one or 
more  research projects
with them.

One of the potential  topics is emerging technologies. The Wharton offers  a 
symposium in Paris on June 10
 on High Tech Acquisitions  and it would make a lot of sense if you
(or somebody from London you could identify) could attend and help us to 
evaluate the usefulness
of this project.

I am enclosing the message from the person in Wharton running this program.


Vince

Vincent,

It was truly a pleasure getting to know you in our meeting yesterday, and I
look forward to the prospect of exchanging views in the future on a variety
of topics pertaining to emerging technologies.

Per our discussion, I've enclosed three files that include an invitation,
agenda and rsvp form for the June 10 symposium on High Tech Acquisitions at
Insead.  If you or the individual(s) who will be attending have any
questions, please email:  Phanish Puranam at: PHANIS20@WHARTON.UPENN.EDU or
you can call him at 215-898-1231.

This initiative will be expanded during the coming year and I believe that
Enron's involvement will give the company access to some of the early
research in progress as it unfolds, and of course, if you become involved
as a partner in the Emerging Technologies Program you would have
opportunities to help guide the direction of the research which is one of
the partnership ""benefits.""

Our next upcoming events are scheduled for:

Friday, September 8
""WHAT NEXT ON THE INTERNET?""
This is a faculty update day with industry partners also invited.
We will co-sponsor this with Wharton's major e-Business initiative.
Major issues addresses include ""New Economics of the Web"" and
""Internet, Anywhere.""

Friday, October 20
""FIRST MOVER ADVANTAGE, SHAKEOUTS & SURVIVAL STRATEGIES""
Designed by the ET core group and
presented in collaboration with the e-Commerce Forum.

As I indicated during our discussion, participation in the Emerging
Technologies Management Research Program is by invitation and on behalf of
our core faculty, I am pleased to extend an invitation for Enron to join
the program.

To assist in your decision, we recommend having a representative attend the
symposium in Paris on June 10 to ""test drive"" the program.

I'll send you a formal invitation which you are free to accept at your
convenience, should you agree that Enron's participation in the ET Program
would be of value.

Please call or email if you have any comments or questions.

best regards,
Michael

Paul Radous asked me to get in touch with you in connection with a proposed 
ISDA Master Agreement with Kellog Supply Services (Europe) Limited.  I should 
be grateful if you would send me by e-mail all documents relating to the ISDA 
recently executed between ENA and Kellog's as Paul would like us to use 
similar provisions.

In passing, I should point out that both I and my colleague, Michael 
Khajeh-Noori, will be dealing with this matter.  I am in the office on 
Mondays and Tuesdays and Michael is in the office on Thursdays and Fridays.  
I should therefore be grateful if you would address any e-mails to both of us 
(we can both be contacted on the same extension: 34539).

If you have any questions, please let me know.

With kind regards

Deepak

Paul: will you be preparing a credit worksheet for this entity?

We have recently concluded an ISDA with The Kellogg  Company in the USA. Now 
their European entity, Kellogg Supply Services (Europe) Limited of The 
Kellogg Building, Talbot Road, Manchester M19 0PU, UK, would like to see an 
ISDA Mastera and Schedule.

Can you look at this entity from a credit point of view please? I do not have 
separate financials for them, but if you need them will ask for a latest set.

Thanks

Did you get the Sappi International financials? And have you made any

ENA and ECT Investments, Inc. on January 22, 2001.

I ask that you please advise me of the following:

(1)  What is the effective date of the Corporate Account Agreement between 
ECI and GSC?  Has it been executed by GSC?

(2)  Is the attached form of assignment acceptable?

(3)  Is there anybody else with GSC that needs to be involved with the 
review/execution of the attached assignment?

Please let me hear from you.  Our commercial group is extremely anxious to 
effectuate the transfer.  Thank you for your assistance.

As you know, now that we are nearly done in capturing the DPR numbers in the 
database, we have been working to present the data in compelling ways.  We 
have started to do this by creating the VaR Limit Usage graphs and the 
Sharpe, Rovar, and Risk - Return graphs.  

I am sorry for the misunderstanding with Ted concerning the latter.  I had 
explained what I wanted to produce in an e-mail and during a Risk Forum 
Luncheon.  Therefore, Shona and I did not expect the reaction we got.  I have 
talked to Naveen and Rudi since then, and we have changed the graphs to be 
agreeable to RAC.

Today I worked on the graphs below.  They show the P&L decomposition for the 
month (rolling 20 business days) up to 9/20 (one in dollar terms and the 
other as a percentage of P&L).  I showed them to Shona, and she thought you 
should see them before Naveen, Rudi, and Ted, because these graphs are very 
powerful and are likely to be controversial.  The graphs show that European 
Gas and UK Power released a lot of prudency.  Half of total P&L for European 
Gas is prudency, and UK Power would have had a loss of about $20 million 
(instead of a gain of $27 million) were it not for prudency.   In the case of 
North American Gas, $46 million gain in new deals partly offset about $106 
million in trading losses.  

Please note that these are rough drafts intended to show what we can do.  I 
do not think that there are problems with the data, but I threw these 
together today, and I have not yet double-checked the accuracy of my 
aggregating calculations.

Please launch the attached spreadsheet, and feel free to call or page me with 
questions or concerns.

Thank you,



Eugenio

And comments of other participants to the AB 1890 deal would also be very 
helpful (like Steve Peace and customer groups).  Ought to show why Glynn's 
making comments like ""we don't want to overanalyze the old deal.""

comments of PG&E and Edison officials in trade press, anlyst reports, and 
speeches which would be inconsistent with the idea that they can now recover 
their shortfall.  In other words, when they were trying to get AB 1890 
passed, when they were fighting Proposition 9, when they floated their ""rate 
reduction bonds"" and when they talked to analysts and rating agencies I'm 
sure they assumed that they would live under the rate freeze and take the 
risk of stranded cost recovery whithin the statutory deadline.

California Utilities' LossesOn Electricity Pose Risk

By REBECCA SMITH

Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

California's two biggest utilities are losing so much
money buying electricity in the state's deregulated
market that they have run up deficits equivalent to half
their net worth in just four months.

If the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed the
price these utilities are allowed to bill their
customers, as currently seems likely, they could become
technically insolvent sometime next year. That would put
pressure on regulators to orchestrate a
multibillion-dollar public bailout, similar to the ""too
big to fail'' response that in the past pushed
governments to rescue banks.

Such a scenario is quietly being discussed by bond-rating
concerns that recently reduced their credit outlooks for
Pacific Gas & Electric Co., a unit of San Francisco-based
PG&E Corp., and Southern California Edison, a unit of
Edison International of Rosemead, Calif. Bond- rating
concerns say they aren't sure how much additional debt
can be borne by the two affected utilities before they
will have difficulty paying their bills.

Probe of California Power Prices Begins, but New Plants
Aren't Seen as Solution (Sept. 11)

Los Angeles Utility Is Benefitting, Surprisingly, From
Deregulation (Sept. 6)

California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Electricity Costs
(Sept. 1)
""If this is just a seasonal aberration, the utilities can
get through it,"" says Lori Woodland, analyst for Fitch
IBCA. ""If it goes on for six or nine months, it's a very
serious situation."" Adds A.J. Sabatelle, senior credit
officer at Moody's Investors Service Inc.: ""At some
point, you have a financial crisis.""

The utilities say they are having no difficulty meeting
expenses and don't envision problems in servicing their
debts. But they are vigorously lobbying state and federal
regulators to change the rules of the game, hoping
somehow to raise rates to make up for the shortfall. The
California utilities' experience may be a harbinger of
what could happen in other states where wholesale power
prices have surpassed the amount that utilities are
allowed to charge their ratepayers.

For now, utilities are making ends meet by going to the
financial markets to borrow money. PG&E, a giant utility
that serves one out of every 20 Americans, is seeking
approval to increase its debt capacity by $1.4 billion.
It is borrowing $200 million, while Edison is tapping
$250 million from the commercial paper market. ""This is
going to be a long, tough road,"" says Jim Scilacci, chief
financial officer for Southern California Edison.

Today's situation represents a complete turnabout from
what was expected when California deregulated its energy
market on March 31, 1998, which opened electricity
pricing to competition. California tried to give its
utilities a competitive edge nationally by deregulating
faster than other states and by creating a mechanism to
allow investor-owned utilities, such as PG&E and Edison,
to quickly pay down debts incurred to serve customers
under the old regulatory system.

To do this, the state legislature set retail rates at
high levels, which, at first, generated fat surpluses for
the utilities. As the money piled up, utilities used it
to pay down debts for generation facilities that were
otherwise unprofitable in the new deregulated world. By
the end of this June, PG&E and Edison together had
collected more than $12 billion and were on track to
finish paying down debts well ahead of the March 31,
2002, deadline set by the legislature. At that point,
rate freezes were to end and retail prices were to
fluctuate with the market.

But all that went out the window in June, when wholesale
power prices surged, topping the rates the utilities were
allowed to charge retail customers. Average prices at
state-sanctioned energy markets were four to five times
the prices of a year earlier, and three to four times the
level utilities could charge customers.

The accumulated shortfall has been so enormous at PG&E,
that analysts expect its deficit to exceed $3 billion by
Oct. 31, more than half its shareholder equity of $5.7
billion, which is defined as assets minus liabilities.
Southern California Edison finished August with a deficit
of $2 billion, equivalent to almost two-thirds its net
worth of $3.2 billion. The utilities, though they have
been accumulating deficits, aren't required to report
these as losses on their earnings statements.

That leaves utilities in a bind. They want to end the
rate freeze to be able to pass on the real cost of
electricity to consumers. But should the freeze end
before the statutory deadline of 2002, they get
clobbered. That is because they will immediately have to
book a loss on their power-purchase deficits. What's
more, they can't use the proceeds from planned
power-plant sales to cover those losses; instead, should
the freeze end, they will be obliged to refund some of
the proceeds to ratepayers. In PG&E's case, the refunds
could total $500 million, while in Edison's case, the
amount is $254 million.

Publicly at least, utility executives insist a mechanism
will be found to let them recoup the money spent on
electricity.

Consumer advocates are gearing up for the fight. Nettie
Hoge, executive director for San Francisco consumer group
Utility Reform Network, says ratepayers shouldn't end up
footing the bill for a deal cut by utilities that
benefited them before prices shot up.

Utility executives are now distancing themselves from the
legislation that got them into such a mess, which was
drafted with their assistance. PG&E Chairman Robert Glynn
says it is best not to ""overanalyze"" the ""old deal.""
Instead, he says, regulators and legislators should sit
down with utilities and construct a new agreement, since
""it's in the broad interests of the state not to have
critical energy infrastructure look like a leper.""

Mr. Glynn says the current deal offers ""mutually assured
destruction"" to both utilities and ratepayers. Something
must be done, he says, or consumers throughout most of
the state will experience ""a San Diego-style rate shock.""
The utility serving that city, San Diego Gas & Electric
Co., ended its freeze a year ago and began passing
wholesale power costs directly through to ratepayers.
Legislators intervened this summer, however, and
temporarily capped retail rates when monthly power bills
nearly tripled. The utility, a unit of Sempra Energy, is
also accumulating a deficit as a result.

So long as banks and bond markets believe the utilities
will be repaid, they will be able to borrow, analysts
say. ""Until we hear politicians of consequence state
otherwise, our position is that we believe the utilities
will be made whole,"" says Richard Cortright, a director
at Standard & Poor's corporate ratings group.

But that opinion could change if it looks like the
utilities will have to swallow a big loss. The result:
lower credit ratings that would raise borrowing costs and
could trigger a downward spiral. ""You're talking about
top-rated companies, though,"" said Ms. Woodland of Fitch
IBCA. ""To get to insolvency, a lot would have to happen.""

In the meantime, utilities are doing all they can to
control the hemorrhaging. They have gotten authority from
regulators to buy more power under long-term contracts at
fixed prices, reducing their vulnerability to spot-market
volatility. And they have petitioned federal regulators
to declare California's market so badly flawed that
generators should be denied market pricing and, even,
ordered to pay refunds.

Nevertheless, several forces are working against them.
Although they can sign bilateral contracts, prices remain
high for those as well. What's more, they can't buy less
power than their customers need. If they don't buy
enough, the California Independent System Operator, the
organization responsible for reliability, will step in
and make purchases for them and send them the bill.

Perhaps the biggest problem facing PG&E and Edison,
though, is one of timing. The California legislature is
out of session until December, and regulators haven't
even really started to address the issue formally. In the
meantime, the utilities' deficit is growing by tens of
millions of dollars daily.

Subject: RE: escrow instruction

Kay:

The person signing the escrow instruction must be someone who is listed on
the incumbency certificate that we previously submitted to Citibank (i.e.,
Thomas or Duran).  Can we change the signatory to Duran as opposed to
Calger?

(I suppose we have the same issue with PPL, as Vicens is not named on PPL's
incumbency certificate and Citibank already raised that issue for them on
the escrow agreement.  I will let Greg Lang know.)

Carolyn,

Please revised the signature page for escrow instruction to reflect Chris
Calger as a signatory.

Thanks,

I am attaching the latest draft of the gas GTC for your review.  Please note 
that in discussions with Rolo and Guillermo yesterday that we determined that 
we cannot call the gas product ""firm"" from a regulatory standpoint since we 
do not plan to have firm transport and firm gas for all delivery points at 
all times.  Additionally, I have started to redraft the damages clauses to 
account for the fact that we may be the defaulting party and that certain of 
our customers may not be able to purchase replacement gas or fuel on a spot 
basis if we decide not to deliver on any given day.  (For that matter we may 
not be able to resell gas on a spot basis if the counterparty does not take 
on a given day.)  Rather than leave this situation ambiguous in the damages 
section we thought it better to address the issue up front.

Julian and I met today on the power GTC and have generated more questions 
than answers at the moment.  Julian, Andrea and I will need to work next week 
on coming up with the next draft.  The key to the next draft is the 
involvement of both Julian and Andrea.  Because of the unique Argentine 
issues in drafting the GTC I will not be able to do much more than raise 
questions and issues (and trying to clarify commercial positions) as I was 
doing today with Julian.  I understand that Andrea may not be able to be in 
Houston the beginning of next week but I would recommend that she come back 
up Wednesday or Thursday and that perhaps Julian come to Houston Thursday 
after his trip to London to help put the documentation to bed.  We are 
working on this as fast as we can but there are some open issues that will 
effect how the documentation will be drafted.  Julian can fill you in on some 
of the details we were working on today.

Mark Taylor and I were on a conference call this morning with outside counsel 
discussing how to structure your online products so they conform to the way 
the rest of Enron is doing Online business and we should have the relevant 
legal risks for Mark's consideration identified by counsel on Wednesday.

Let me know if you have any questions.



Here is the last draft of the product description for gas.

I am greatly concerned that the status of the power GTC is going to hold us 
up at this point. I am aware you are all working on it today and Monday but 
as far as I can see this document is only about 20 % done. Please put the 
necessary time and attention into completing this document. I would like to 
see a the draft  distributed after Julian and Brent have worked on it today. 
I will submit my comments this weekend in advance of the Monday work session 
with Andrea.

All
Per Darrell and Jerry's comments below, we can proceed with the unloader installation at any time. I talked to Ed and had a message from Jon. Jon is tied up in Florida through the 22nd, probably. He can be at Station 8 the week of the 25th. He'll check and confirm that.

Gene and I talked and we'll plan on doing the install on both units (one at a time) the week of the 25th.

Thanks
Mike

Just let gas control know what units you are going to have unavailable.  You can proceed with the project.

Mike, I think we can go ahead and do the work. There is no flow affect right now, so I don't see a problem doing one unit at a time. Darrell what's your thoughts?

Here is a blank outage request form Mike.

Darrell / Jerry
We are about ready to install the unloader system at Station 8 to wrap up the automation project. We've been working on installing electrical and mechanical equipment without disabling the units. The valve people estimate 2 days per unit to install the valve actuators / unloaders and do some commissioning work. We just need one unit at a time.

Do we need to wait until the tarriff months are over? Jerry can you send me an outage request form?

Kit,
	Sorry about not being able to get back with you on the PX issue yesterday. I will be wrapped up today until this afternoon. Give the Dan or Clark a call and have them walk you through this invoice, the number are listed at the bottom of the second e-mail. Find out where the PX short pay is encompassed in the account summary(about 9 million dollars). Once you walk through this with them, give me a call on my cell and lets discuss before we comment back to the lawyers. Sorry about having to pass the buck, but they have Murray and I scrambling. Call me on my cell if you need any further guidance.

							Chris

PARTICIPANTS:
Enclosed is your updated Account Activity Statement summarizing all accounts receivable/payables activities with CalPX occurring during 2001 starting with the issuance of the December Day-Ahead/Day-Of Market invoice back in January through the April Real Time invoices in August.
The April billing cycles are adjustments being made by CAISO that go back as far as Spring 2000.  CAISO is continuing to make these adjustments, which are basically meter corrections and approved scheduling coordinator disputes, for prior periods.  These will probably continue for a few more months because of the recent FERC ruling regarding refunds.
Please feel free to call Don Deach (626-685-9876), Rachel Axelrad (626-685-9843) or Clark Cheng (626-685-9846) with any questions.
Thank You.

This is the last deal that is in the FT-Norhtwest book that needs to be
flipped into the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book, to settle between ECC and
Duke Energy Marketing Limited Partnership.  This needs to be fixed so
liquidations will be correct for Novmeber.

There seems to be some confusion about this deal, so please call me
or Greg Carraway about this deal, and maybe we can answer questions
if there are any.

Thanks
Stacey

Subject: Need your help representing your Analysts

As you probably know, the Western Hemisphere A&A PRC will be held in Houston 
on July 19th.  Each member of the PRC committee will represent 15 to 17 
analysts that have been randomly assigned. I've been selected as a member of 
the Analyst PRC Committee representing participants that are under your 
direct supervision.  As a PRC rep, I will continue to represent the assigned 
Analysts (see list below) during their entire tenure with the Analyst Program.

Thus, I need your help in supplying me performance information for these 
candidates (including pre-ratings if available) and recommendations for 
promotion if he or she is eligible.  In addition, for those of you based out 
of Houston I'd like to meet with each of you individually (15 or 20 minutes 
should be enough) during the 17th and the 18th of July (if you are not based 
out of Houston or you'll be out of town during those days, we can certainly 
do it over the phone the week of the 10th.
I'm based out of Sao Paulo (in transition from Buenos Aires) and I'll be 
landing in Houston the morning of the 17th, so I'll be ready to begin these 
short meetings by 11am on the 17th.  I would very much appreciate if you can 
indicate your time preference for those two days. 

FYI, the following is the list of participants that I'll be representing in 
the July 19th PRC meeting:

Analyst Name    Supervisor
Ahanchian, Amir Cyrus    Humphrey, Gene
Allen, Margaret     Palmer, Mark
Ashmore, Garrett    Cox, David    
Benien, Michael     Moscoso, Michael
Black, Robin     Lewis, James

Mena, Luis     Leibert, Richard
O'Malley, Justin     Pittenger, Cathy
Scarborough, John    Courtney, Mark
Vegalara, Mateo    Thomsen, Jon


Please call me at 5511-5503-1397 in Sao Paulo or at 5411-4891-3600 in Buenos 
Aires.  It will be of enormous help if you can let us know the name and 
telephone number of your assistants so Marianne Arake (Sao Paulo 
5511-5503-1197) and/or Nadia Rodriguez (Buenos Aires 5411-4891-3644) can 
follow up on the schedule in Houston.

Thanks for your co-operation.

Just checked with Richmond Hill Inn in Asheville and they are open over
Thanksgiving.  Not filled yet for that time period.  They are sending me a
brochure.  Only potential draw back there is that most of their rooms have
only king size beds and sleep two persons.  There are 2 rooms that have two
beds, and two cottages that have sleeper sofas.  They do have baby beds.
Families of 2 or 3 can be accomodated fine.  I would probably take two
rooms, one for the girls and one for Tyler, David and me.  But we would
probably do that in New York or San Francisco, too.  As we all know, five
is almost too many in one room and bathroom.

I think that dinner in Austin on June 2 and a trip at Thanksgiving sounds
like a good plan.  Do you guys want to cover that with Mom and Dad and ask
about the San Antonio/Sun City crowd?

Hello, Sista -

Sally and I spoke this morning (I know you guys spoke last night as well) -
and here's the latest idea:

Since August, Sept., and Oct.  are pretty much impossible for a trip, how
about we schedule a trip - possibly to NYC or San Fran. - during
THanksgiving.  This seems ideal since we always get together anyway at that
time - and nobody will have to remove kids from school.  Sally thinks maybe
we could travel Tuesday - Saturday and avoid some of the Thanksgiving
travel
MADNESS.  Also, it pushes the travel even further into the year, which may
help you.

Then, we can have a family dinner for Mom and Dad on June 2 somewhere in
Austin.  We can include Maryann and Fabe and San Antonio cousins IF mom and
dad would like that.

Thoughts?   -Cara

Though many of you already know, today is my last day here at Enron.  I am leaving to pursue my culinary interests full time and have accepted a baking/pastry apprenticeship with the Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah for the winter season.  

I am happy to have spent the past 3 years working with such a fun and intelligent group of people. I sincerely wish all of you the best in your future endeavors.

Please don't hesitate to look me up if you are in the Park City area, vacation planning, or considering some radical career change like this...ha.  It would be great to see old friends up there.  Forwarding info is below:

Thanks.  It worked.  Carolyn let me know that y'all would like to fund by

cursory glance through the blackline faxed to me shows that outside counsel
will most likely not be necessary.

Subject: Re: Business Review

I agree that makes a lot of sense, that is certainly where we are spending our
time, and good management of that so far, is what is contributing to earnings
higher than expected....that and the crazy California markets. We're always
glad to have you visit, and could provide a detailed discussion if that's what
you would prefer. We are spending a great deal of time on this in the sales
presentations and have a number of overheads, and some written information
that we use in our position meetings that we could send to you to start with.
The rate case is in a very dynamic state, but we believe moving in right
direction. The power position is in constant review based on projected loads,
demand side management opportunities, and blocks of energy available at
reasonable prices in the future for our customers. We are still operating
under an obligation to serve, as we don't see that changing anytime in the
near future and those utilities in the west that have gotten in trouble are
those who haven't provided for customers. Commissions seem to be giving rate
increases for increasing prices if prudent management was attempted, but not
just for stopping based on possible belief of dereg. We have a sharing
mechanism right now that shares risks and rewards between customers and
shareholders. During this sales process we had spent a lot of time working
through with Sierra on this, and now with the new possible buyers. Most like
it when they finally understand. It is not regulation 101, it is very complex
and leading edge, but get the risks and rewards aligned much better for
shareholdes and customers. Doesn't fit Enron's view of dereg, but Oregon will
not get to Enron's view anytime soon, especially with California situation,
and it's not just Oregon regulators, it's Oregon customers including the
industrials that are  reliability sensitive like high techs and health care. 
Sorry for the long note....how about if I start by sending you some
information from presentations, and then we can look at schedules for when a
meeting might work. You might even want to come to one of the banker
presentations. Mark M and Mitch were both in Seattle yesterday, and could
share with you some of the discussion related to these subjects. Mitch thought
we might have another in a week or so.....      

>>> Horton, Stanley 05/08/01 09:37AM >>>
After returning home and reviewing the material handed out at the PGE business
review, there are two areas that I think I need to understand better.  The
first is PGE's energy positions going forward and the financial exposures to
changing prices.  The second is the rate case.  I would be happy to return to
Portland to get a more in depth review with a much smaller cast of players.  I
am open to suggestions from you.

Given the status of the divestiture process, Jeff wants to make sure he (and
subsequently I) have a good handle on these two important issues.

Thanks!

My consultant buddy, Tom Beach is the technical consultant for Jerry Bloom's organization, the California Cogeneration Coalition (or something like that).  About 1000 MW of cogen throughout the state.  I've tentatively set up a meeting with him for Wednesday at 11 AM.  So we can do Alcantar at 9, and Tom at 11.  That work?

Hi,

I work at Enron as a power trader and Gary Hagerty asked me to forward any prospects for a ""junior power risk management"" position at Epcor onto you. 

Michael Wong worked for us on booking the Sundance B PPA position and was let go soon after this was sold to TransCanada/Altagas and if you're still looking for someone, he would be worth investigating.  

Regards,
Cooper Richey

You'll have to take that personally with Ms. Heard.  For you, it would have 
much more personal impact than ""Most Favored Nation"" status.  I would 
certainly want to stay on Marie good side.  Though I know it is tough to 
compete with sweet Russell...

On a monthly basis, the Rate and Currency Desk submits interest rate and 
foreign currency spot curve validations to the Risk Controls group.  In the 
past this data was sent via email to either Mike Moscoso, Chris Abel or Gary 
Stadler.   Going forward we will send infomation to Eugenio Perez.  FYI - 
Arthur Andersen audits these curve validations annually.

Attached please find the curve validation procedures, including source pages, 
and most current validation dated 10/31/00.  I will be more than happy to go 
over the validation process in detail if interested.

Dear Monique,

The gas processing plant has been shut down for many years and is in fact 
dismantled.  I would leave off any mention.
There is an active compressor station in fact it was converted to electric 
from gas in 1999.
There is still an active underground storage facility.  Capabilities have 
improved from what you have to the following:
 Storage Capacity: 70 BCF to 115 BCF
 Maximum Injection Capacity: 510,000 Mcf/d
 Maximum Withdrawal Capacity:  1,400,000 Mcf/d
Call 713-853-7705 if you have questions.

Some further questions:
 


Are we required to have a formal severance plan?  Can we opt not to have a severance plan and simply handle matters on a case-by-case basis (perhaps with ""rule of thumb"" guidelines)?

If we are required to have such a plan, should we centrally administer the plan to avoid inconsistencies?

My original message regarding the employee involved was raising a somewhat broader concern.  Perhaps because our plans are complicated, we have had occasions where an employee was told something, what he/she was told was incorrect, he/she changed position based on what he/she was told, and then we made the employee bear the risk of the mistake.  Obviously, the right answer is to get it right the first time, but on those occasions where we made the mistake, do we have the flexibility to fix it?

Shelley,
In addition to the valuable discussion notes you've listed in your memo, here 
are some things I'd like to see covered:

1.  Report card on the financial success of the first series of merchant 
plants.

2.  The growth in the secondary market (2nd and 3rd owners) for generation 
facilities.

3.  Brief discussion of the basic economic differences (capital vs. O&M & 
fuel) of fully depreciated (formerly utility) electric generation facilities 
and the latest generation high efficiency gas turbines, and the 
implications/opportunities for gas suppliers/transporters.

4.  Understanding of the contractual nature of electric power sales, long 
term contracts vs. merchant sales into PX markets, and the implications of 
these contractual arrangements on gas suppliers/transporters.

Thanks for putting this together for us.

Please plan to attend an in-house training session on an ""Introduction to the 
Electric Industry.""   Jim Crist, a lecturer with IGT  is preparing a day-long 
seminar customized to our interests and issues.   

Here is my ""top 4 list"" on why GPG staff need to increase our understanding 
of the electric industry.

First and foremost, gas-fired electric generation is the growth market for 
gas pipelines.  We need to get a sense of why and where generation is being 
built and who the likely customers are.  This involves understanding the 
different between utility generation and merchant plants, the dynamics of 
siting, understanding a little bit about how utilities plan and economically 
justify generation investments.
Second, we need to understand electric utilities as customers.  Who is the 
customer these days -- the generator?  Who should we be dealing with within 
the utility organization.  What types of load patterns should we expect 
various types of electric players?  What types of services do they need?  We 
also need to get a sense of how the timing of their processes 
compare/contrast to our processes on the gas side.
Third, we need to understand the regulatory climate on the electric side and 
the implications for electric generation demand growth.  We need to 
understand the state/federal jurisdictional issues.  We need to learn about 
the debates over ATC, TLR, locational marginal pricing, price caps, and 
control areas.  We need to understand how these issues fit into Enron's 
position in support of restructuring the electric industry, unbundling 
transmission, removing native load exceptions, and avoiding prices caps and 
we need to understand how these debates affect GPG.
 Fourth, we need to understand electric tariffs and practices, services and 
OASIS because the FERC has started to insist on common rules between gas and 
electric.  The recent electric interconnection policy has now been applied on 
the gas side.  FERC is talking about imposing the RTO principles on 
pipelines. And, we hear a lot of comparisons between OASIS and pipeline 
EBBs.  We want to learn how to take advantage of electric best practices 
where it makes sense and on the flip side, know how to argue against the 
imposition of electric rules on our pipelines where there are legitimate 
differences between gas and electric.

I've shared this list of interests with Jim Crist as he prepares a customized 
seminar for us.  Please feel free to email me with any other areas of 
interest for the course.   I will keep you posted on the specific location as 
things progress.  In the meantime, please make sure to save the date!   
Please pass this notice along to others in your organization that may be 
interested.

CERA Decision Brief 



Title: Refined Products Markets--The Fallout from September 11 	
URL(s):	

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2717;


***********************************************************************

WEAKENING DEMAND TO PUT THE SQUEEZE ON SPOT REFINING MARGINS

Oil demand growth is slowing dramatically in the aftermath of the September 11 
terrorist attacks. The combination of sluggish GDP growth and a sharp decrease 
in commercial air travel will in CERA's view result in declines in quarterly 
oil demand in fourth quarter 2001 and first quarter 2002. Spot refining margins 
are expected to trend downward, with the possibility of periods of upward 
volatility. Key factors that will influence the path of margins for the balance 
of this year and into 2002 include

*  weakening supply-demand fundamentals, as weak economies and reduced 
commercial air travel drive down demand

*  OPEC production policy and its effect on inventory levels

*  supply security concerns, including perceived risks of disruptions to 
physical supply that could result from new attacks or military action

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
? Multiple MOU Plans Debated
? California State Budget Faces One Last Hurdle

Budget 
There is a small possibility that Sen. Burton will not recess the Senate on 
Thursday unless the Senate passes the budget that the Assembly passed last 
night (7-17). However a key Democrat, Sen. Sheila Kuehl, has been is in Italy 
and is on a 16 hour return flight. No one knows if she has been told to 
return and without her presence, two Republican votes are still needed to 
pass any urgency measure for the budget.  Kuehl's vote is crucial if they 
take the bill up on Thursday. 
MOU Mayhem
There are currently three leading MOU plans being resuscitated by the 
California House and Senate deliberations.  Senator Burton is hoping to keep 
the published schedule and adjourn for a month's recess on Thursday evening.  
Speaker Hertzberg is reportedly not thrilled with leaving until the Edison 
issue is resolved.  However, rumor is that whether or not they recess on 
Thursday, their adjournment will mark the end of the Second Extraordinary 
session and all XX  bills passed and signed will go into effect in 90 days 
(all others will be dead).  Although Davis has stressed the urgency of 
passing a comprehensive ""bail-out"" plan and even threatened to call an 
emergency session to prevent legislators from taking a 30-day recess on 
Friday, there is no clear indication that legislators will comply with this 
request.      
? Hertzberg's bill 82XX - Of the more obvious differences from Davis MOU,  
82XX proposes to offer SoCal $300 M less for its transmission lines in 
addition to penalizing Edison if it fails to act in good faith in closing the 
deal.  It comes as no surprise that during bill deliberations, SoCal raised 
objections to the bill and warned of impending difficulties (bankruptcy) for 
So Cal were the bill left unamended.
? The Wright-Richman bill 83XX - We reported last week that 83XX remains the 
only measure fueled by bipartisan support.  AB 83XX was heard in an 
""informational"" hearing yesterday (7-17) and will be heard again today in the 
Assembly Energy Committee.  Assemblyman Rod Wright, the Chairman of the 
Committee, presented AB 83xx with Dr. Keith Richman, a Republican Assemblyman 
from Southern California. They offered 83XX as an Edison bail-out, pure and 
simple. Wright was clear to distinguish his bill from 82XX, which he said has 
conservation easements and land requisitions, a renewable portfolio which 
will add an additional fee on ratepayers, and reasonable review for long term 
contracts. While the chances of the Richman bill being successful appear 
slim, reports that that Hertzberg will try to negotiate elements of his own 
bill (82XX) as amendments to the Wright/Richman measure suggest that at least 
Hertzberg feels Richman's 83XX stands a chance. 

? The Byron Sher bill, SB 78XX (Polanco) - Previously presented by Sen. 
Polanco on behalf of Governor Davis, SB 78XX has received special attention 
from Senate President, John Burton.  Although it has never been heard by a 
committee, SB 78XX is currently on the Senate floor and ready for a vote. The 
Senate Energy Committee and Senate Appropriations Committee are both 
scheduled to have informational hearings on this bill today.  Note, the 
meetings are informational because neither committee has possession of the 
bill.  These hearings will provide information to committee members, avoid a 
formal vote, and simultaneously shield Burton/Polanco from claims that the 
details of SB78XX were never released.  The Senate is scheduled to be in 
session tomorrow, ostensibly to vote on the state budget and SB 78XX. Given 
Burton's penchant for wanting to keep on schedule to recess tomorrow, there 
is no guarantee that he will hold the Senate in session once they hear SB 
78XX. Thus, the Senate may never even see AB 82XX and AB 83XX unless either 
or both bills are passed out of the Assembly today and get special treatment 
by Burton to be heard tomorrow. Burton has previously adjourned the Senate to 
keep on schedule once they finish their business, even if the Assembly is 
behind them. "

Jim:

I agree.  However, it probably would make some sense to have EWS legal look 
at any particularly complex pricing structures that may be passed by the EWS 
desk.

We  have not discussed EWS involvement in Term Sheets.  I would think 
contract review would be enough (do you really want mor things to review?),  
but will defer to your judgement.

Gentlemen--thought you guys might be interested in this exchange on Gray 
Davis's visit to Mayor Daley.  EES has been trying to do a deal with the City 
of Chicago for quite a while now, and they are getting down to the wire in 
deciding whether to go ahead as the deal is going to have to go before the 
City Council next month for approval.

Roy and Ed,
Actually, this is a non-event for us.  Davis was in town to review the City's 
emergency action plan in the event of massive or rolling blackouts.  Steve 
Walter met with him to brief him of the City's extremely thorough emergency 
plan which was a result of the power outages a few summers ago.  The City is 
looked to across the country as having a state-of-the-art plan that 
encompasses over 1,600 critical facilities classified with an A-C rating.  
Each of these City, County or State facitlities had a ""hook-up"" plate 
installed on the outside of the building so a portable generator could be 
moved into place in an emergency.  The plan also covers procedures, planning, 
operations support center set up, etc.  Very comprehensive.  I suppose Mr. 
Davis may just be thinking ahead....
Mike

PS.  If the conversation actually did extend into what else the City is doing 
about electricity and Enron's name also came up, I doubt that we would be 
viewed negatively at all, in fact, the exact opposite.  We are part of 
Daley's plan to lessen his reliance on the terrible utility.  We are the 
hammer and our long-term contract reinforces our relationship.  You can rest 
assured, if California could do it all over again, long-term contracts would 
be a key component of a successful move to deregulation...not spot market 
purchases through a PX!  Ah yes, Chicago, the apple of Gov. Davis' eye...

Subject: Re: Chicago  

Ed -- I don't think that this would change what we are trying to do nor the 
way we're doing it.  Daley is not afraid to take non-liberal positions when 
it best fits his ends ( e.g., he has made statements supporting the 
President's energy policy because he has more faith in increasing supply 
rather than in demand reductions) but since this is politics one can never be 
entirely sure.  I'm sure that Daley knows Enron very well and especially 
where Mr. Lay placed his support during the last election.  My read on this 
algnment is that Daley will do what it takes to keep the energy issue from 
becoming a ""snow storm"" type of issue -- for non-Chicagoans that refers to 
the ability for administrations to change over how well the City clears 
neighborhood streets during the previous winter's snow days.

The bold highlight appears in Sunday gossip column of the Chicago Suntimes - 
does this meeting change the political 
dynamics of the deal - Davis adversial relationship with Enron - is this 
something we should be worried about

           

               May 20, 2001

               BY MICHAEL SNEED SUN-TIMES COLUMNIST 

           

               Scoopsville . . .

               Watch for California Gov. Gray Davis, who has been hit by his 
state's energy
               crisis, to visit Mayor Daley this week and ask for pointers. 
Daley is the fella who
               successfully hammered ComEd into submission.

               A blues whisper . . .

               Pssst! Mayor Daley has been asking questions about the status 
of Gerri's Palm
               Tavern, a legendary blues tavern at 446 E. 47th, whose future 
is the center of an
               ongoing South Side neighborhood debate.

               Ol' Man River . . .

               There wasn't a dry eye in the house.

               Actor/singer/professor William Warfield, 82, who was presented 
with the Chicago
               Historical Society's Making History Award Thursday night, 
stunned the audience
               when he repeated history.

               * To wit: Warfield, a Grammy winner, opera singer and 
professor of music at the
               University of Illinois and Northwestern University, sang . . . 
the song he made
               famous in the 1951 hit movie ""Show Boat,"" starring Ava 
Gardner, Kathryn
               Grayson and Howard Keel: ""Ol' Man River.""

               Tips & twaddle . . .

               * Wonder when Tom Cruise, who is divorcing Nicole Kidman, is 
going to rename
               his plane? It's called: ""Sweet Nic.""

               * Presidential daughter Jenna Bush, who just pleaded no 
contest to a charge of
               underage drinking, reportedly wears a toe ring.

               * Former Veep Al Gore may have gained 30 pounds, but the 
Washington Post is
               reporting former President Bill Clinton has dropped almost 20 
pounds.

               * Attorney General John Ashcroft reportedly holds daily prayer 
sessions with
               Justice Department employees.

               * Harvey Mayor Nickolas Graves tells Sneed that World 
Changers, a Southern
               Baptist volunteer organization, hits Harvey next month--at his 
invitation--to restore
               and rehabilitate homes, including two historical homes on 
154th Street.

               Celluloid chat . . .

               The chapel at McInerney Funeral Home will be filled today, but 
not with people
               attending a funeral.

               * Translation: The 128-year-old Canaryville funeral home is 
the site of filming for
               ""Stolen Summer,"" the Miramax film written by Chicago native 
Pete Jones, who
               won the Project Greenlight contest organized by Matt Damon and 
Ben Affleck.
               The film stars actors Aidan Quinn, Kevin Pollak and Brian 
Dennehy. According
               to Celine McInerney, this is the first time the funeral home 
has been used for
               anything but . . . funerals.

Attached is the revised version of the Plant/Field Draft 1 sent to you on 
Nov. 9, 2000. Draft 1 should have been adopted with customization prior to 
Nov. 14, 2000 to be Grandfathered under the requirements of OSHA's final rule 
1910.900 (c). The revised attachment revises Draft 1, changing what is 
necessary for a prior written program to continue to be Grandfathered. 
Because we would not have had the final rule prior to Nov. 14, OSHA gives us 
until Jan. 16, 2001 to amend a prior written program and bring it in line 
with the requirements of 1910.900 (c). That is what this revision does. 

Some items are marked ""optional"" and are just that. Removing any other part 
of the text should only be done after you are satisfied doing so does not 
leave you short of meeting the requirements of 1910.900 (c).

If you have questions, I am at 713-646-7840.

Reminder copy of Steve's message today:
In light of the challenges being offered by the Ergonomics Standard and to 
ensure that each group within Enron understands the importance of the 
Grandfather requirements, we have scheduled a meeting on Thursday, November 
30, at 1 PM CST. Those of you who will be in Houston can get together in the 
Crisis Center (EB4554) and others can join in the meeting via conference call 
at 877 795-3687, Access Code 539773. Russ has told me the meeting may last an 
hour, depending on questions. He has also informed me that prior to our 
meeting we should all read the document attached in his memo below.

Thanks in advance for your participation.

Energy Operations has two sets of season tickets for Astros games this 
season.  One set is four tickets in the field box level, and the other set is 
two tickets in the terrace level.  I have also purchased one parking spot in 
a lot that is a couple of blocks from the stadium.  I have divided the 
tickets among you, with my husband's help.  He identified ""good games"" (i.e. 
teams that everyone likes to see), and those are distributed equally across 
my direct reports.  Tickets for the other games have been distributed based 
your percentage of Energy Operations employees.  For most games, you will 
receive all six tickets.  You can use these tickets for yourself and for a 
small reward for a job well done by someone in your group.  The parking 
information will accompany the group of four field box tickets.  Patti is 
including a map of downtown with the parking lot pinpointed.  Your tickets 
will be distributed to you this week.  I hope that you and your staff will 
enjoy these.  

I also received over 100 tickets from Cliff Baxter, Greg Whalley and Dave 
Delainey for the exhibition game on Saturday, April 1.  I have chosen to 
distribute two tickets a piece to all directors and managers in Energy 
Operations who are not my direct reports.  SInce you will have first call on 
the season tickets going to your group, I thought that it would be nice to 
make these tickets available to the next tier of leadership.  I wanted to 
make you aware of this before these are distributed tomorrow.  

Finally, I have purchased a block of tickets for two upcoming games, one a 
weekday afternoon and one a weekend.  I will let you know these dates soon, 
as I would like for my direct report group to join me at these games. "

I received this email from Karen Taylor at Duke Field Services.  I have been working with her on gathering deals whereby ENA could purchase 3rd party gas on the Jonah Gas Gathering system.  As you can see, a numerber of our larger trading counterparties are not willing to trade with us, but are unwiling to tell us directly.  I hope this is a short term problem, as most of the larger counterparties account for the majority of our transactions.  I've included the second part of the email to show you both that I am willing to extend myself in whatever manner to bring value to the once mighty Enron.

PS  I haven't been able to close any deals with Karen, but I feel that I am very close!

Tony, I thought there would be a case that stated that if an interstate 
pipeline posts the criteria under which it will evaluate capacity bids, it 
must stick to those criteria and not award the capacity to a bidder on some 
other basis.  It seems a simple enough extension of the principle that 
capacity must be awarded on a nondiscriminatory basis.  However, I did not 
find any case that stands for that exact proposition.  As you may be aware, 
the Commission made Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) come up 
with a way to ensure that it awarded capacity one a nondiscriminatory 
basis...because NGPL was found to have been giving preferential treatment to 
its shippers.  NGPL's solution was to come up with an auction process, and 
there is a whole line of cases if you're interested.  The underlying 
presumption is that if you set up a system under which all capacity is 
awarded and stick with that system, there is no way you could be acting 
discriminatorily.  But of course the Commission never comes out and says this 
even though it should be obvious.

Probably the best we can do is extrapolate from 1) the tariff and 2) the NGA 
(doesn't it also say we have to provide service on a not unduly discrim. 
basis?).  Also, in your memo I'd give an example; i.e., if we notify shippers 
of our auction process and set a deadline for bidding, but then award the 
capacity to Sempra (assuming Sempra requested capacity after the posting), we 
will have unduly discriminated against all the other shippers who had to 
participate in the auction process.  

Maybe in future postings on Enrononline we should include a statement to the 
effect that the capacity posted will not be awarded except thru the 
Enrononline process.

Now for some trivia.  Remember we were discussing with Shelley whether we 
could post a different method (other than that prescribed in the tariff) for 
determining best bid?  In my Westlaw search I ran across the relevant case.  
In Northwest Pipeline, 85 FERC P 61,335, the Commission stated:  ""The 
Commission has previously given pipelines the leeway, in open season 
provisions, to either include in their tariff a single non-discriminatory bid 
evaluation methodology, or provide themselves the flexibility of choosing 
different non-discriminatory bid evaulation methods for different 
transactions, provided that the pipeline posts the bid evaluation methodology 
before the bidding process begins.""  The only problem is I am not sure we 
have that ""flexibility"" since the tariff does not expressly allow us to post 
a different method.  Maybe next time we do a tariff cleanup we could add some 
language allowing us to do so.

I have to move on to my next project but if you want me to comment on what 
you write I'd be happy to.

Dennis,

To follow up from our meeting today, please provide the delivery report that includes the following:

WHAT	Total volumes (by month) delivered to primary delivery points versus alternate delivery points
WHEN	For the period of 5/00 thru 10/31
WHERE	For all delivery points West of Thoreau (including: Calif pool, Window Rock, PGE/Mojave Topock and SOCAL Needles)
WHO	Send to William Rapp (legal), Kim Watson and myself

This information will be used to respond to criticism by the California PUC.  I believe that Bill Rapp is wanting to respond by early Wednesday so if he could get these numbers by end of day Monday, I'm sure he'd appreciate it.

Thanks for your help,

Jarrod it seems the reference to Sydney time for a Melborne weather

Subject: Re: Yipes - Syd vs Melbon - HDD swap  

I agree this change could cause problems. During September 2000  daylight 
saving will start early in Sydney during the Olympics. As a result there will 
be a 1 hour time difference between Sydney and Melbourne.  The local time as 
reported by the Bureau of Meteorology is Melbourne time. Hence if there is to 
be a reference to a time zone it should time zone applicable to that 
location. More generally we should put a definition of ""LST ""in documentation 
as meaning the time at the relevant weather station. We could have a 
circumstance of reference weather stations in difference time zones (eg 
basket of cities).

Dear Heidi,

1.
I confirm that this is now a swap rather than a bought option.  

2.
To DAVID,
"".... Please let me know if you think this document is acceptable........""

Since Jared has replaced LST with Sydney time -

should this be Melbourne time instead ?????

Raymond

The confirmation I have received below looks to be the deal we were talking 
about when I was in Houston. Is this correct? At that stage, were we not 
talking about there being a significant premium payable at the start of the 
deal. It appears from the confirmation below that this is now a swap rather 
than a bought option.  Can you please confirm that this therefore the same 
deal.

Jarrod looks fine. For completeness I have noted one minor inconsistency in 
(v) of the Fallback Data provisions that dates back to my first draft. Our 
rounding of degrees celsuis is to one decimal point. Hence the reference to 
whole numbers may not be apropriate in all cases. In practical terms it is so 
immaterial I question the need to redo the confirmation. Anyway please put 
together the the confirmation between between Enron Australia Finance Pty. 
Ltd. and RMT. I have copied in Susan (Tax) and Heidi (Finance) to double 
check they are fully aware of this arrangement.

David,

I have attached a copy of the Confirmation that we sent to Aquila. They have 
read it and returned a signed copy to me. Please let me know if you think 
this document is acceptable. If it is I will go ahead and put together the 
Transaction between RMT and Australia. If we need to make any changes, I will 
send a revised copy to Aquila and then do the back to back transaction.

Thank you,

the order has a lot of good information in it that I wanted to share with the

britt,

thanks your reply which is noted. you will notice i have excluded david best 
and ngregson (?) preferring to keep my comments in house as privileged info, 
unless you feel this msg should be forwarded to them later.

firstly, i am getting nowhere with mitsubishi on the settlement front. i have 
gone so far as to mention this morning to mitsuru that if this does goes to 
arbitration, and should mitsubishi succeed in their position, this will only 
serve to increase our claim by a similar amount since these costs would then 
become part of our contamination claim. he seems quite content to let this go 
to arbitration. as an example, he was suppose to call me back this afternoon 
but did not.

secondly, with regards to your comments, i would just respond/add the 
following information:

1. i don't know if i am switching tactics so much as following what should 
have been done in the beginning (i.e. submit the claim to our insurance 
company and let them proceed against the owners). i honestly feel the 
arbitrators will say, ""pay the freight (and possibly the demurrage now) and 
settle the contamination claim as a separate issue"". clearly, the c/p says 
that freight is due without deduction once the vessel has completed discharge.

on the issue of the ""pre-sale"" survey, i have discussed this matter 
internally with eric tan. seems our position is that singapore considered the 
sample that was drawn as a bad sample as well as we were not sure that the 
test methods used conformed with the testing methods required for first gas. 
this position is proved by the loading of the pacific virgo when the product 
subsequently tested on-spec for first gas. granted, it might still become an 
issue but, as you say. it could become an issue in either proceeding.

i am getting a little confused on the matter of the joint testing. verbally i 
was advised that enron did not want to have the joint testing - at least not 
on a prompt basis. your msg now says that we do want to test the product and 
it should be done as soon as possible (as mitsubishi - and your advices that 
the underwriters and hear owner's p and i club would want). i assume this 
change is the result of the arbitration. 

be that as it may, i do have a bit of information that you may, or may not, 
be aware of or find relevant. when eric tan and i visited first gas in 
mid-oct to meet the personnel at first gas and witness one of the cargoes 
being discharged at the plant, we also took the opportunity to meet with sgs 
in subic bay to see their facilities and meet their personnel. during the 
conversation the subject of the elang cargo came up and the comment from sgs 
is that they were fairly certain it was off-spec due to ""bugs"". this may 
sound silly but i have heard of this before and is a problem with petroleum 
products.

it seems sgs even went so far as to test the product themselves for these 
""bugs"" and got a positive result. this test was not requested by enron or 
first gas and was done some time later in this process. i understand there 
may be some concern on our part over our subsequent sales to third parties if 
we knew there were bugs in the product. i would have to say that this was not 
known at the time and even today is only conjecture based on sgs' advices 
mid-oct (well after these sales). sgs also described ""changes"" to the product 
which would fit with the cargo having bugs (i.e. a strong sulphur smell and 
change in colour).

if the testing is now done, i do not know if these bugs will be detected or 
not. however, if they are in the ship's samples, they may have changed the 
sample sufficiently that even a visual observation may detect the problem. 
the next problem becomes proving from where the bugs originated. were they in 
the previous cargo tanks that were not cleaned properly? or were they in the 
condensate when the cargo was loaded? obviously, testing of the shore sample 
prior to loading will determine the answer. if the shore sample is ok, then 
they had to come from the ship. if the shore sample also has bugs, then we 
should be claiming against our suppliers.

this of course assumes the suggestion put forth by sgs is in fact correct. 
just something else to be considered.

2) i am not saying that we pay the full amount immediately but only the 
freight portion (about $500,000). we then advise mitsubishi (or their 
lawyers) that we will now review the demurrage claim (about $260,000) and 
revert by say end nov. the demurrage claim has been sent to our london 
office's demurrage department and i have asked them for their comments on the 
claim. after all, there may be issues with the ship's pumping performance or 
simple laytime errors which may reduce the demurrage claim. they will try to 
get me a response before the weekend.

in this manner, we pay part of the money but still have a smaller portion 
which we may apply against our claim once the test results are known. i will 
leave this to legal as to decide how the approach to mitsubishi or their 
lawyers should be made

   Word of the Day for Friday March 15, 2002:

   sunder \SUN-dur\, transitive verb:
   To break apart; to separate; to divide; to sever.

   intransitive verb:
   To become parted, disunited, or severed.

     As  the  issue  of  slavery threatened to sunder the United
     States, President Abraham Lincoln, using biblical language,
     warned that ""a house divided against itself cannot stand.""
     --Morris  B. Abraham, ""Using the bully pulpit at the United
     Nations,"" [1]Minneapolis Star Tribune, January 20, 1997

     Momentous  business  was at hand, as the last colonial ties
     with  England  were  about  to be sundered, and Madison was
     compelled  to take his stand for both a separation from the
     mother  country  and  the  erection of a republican form of
     government.
     --Robert  A.  Rutland,  James  Madison  and  the Search for
     Nationhood

     Their  romance  was  sundered  by  World  War  II,  and she
     scarcely saw Tito again until 1953.
     --""Tribute:  For  40  Years  Prima  Ballerina  Dame  Margot
     Fonteyn  Created  a  Soaring  Legend  of Grace and Beauty,""
     [2]People, March 11, 1991

Mike,

Please see the attached L/C format to cover physical delivery of natural gas 
for one month.

As discussed, the L/C amount should be $1.6 million to expire Oct. 15, 2000.  
In addition the L/C should be in the name of Hilcorp Energy Company.  I also, 
left you an additional voice mail, stating that once we have received a faxed 
copy of the L/C from your bank, we will then be willing to flow gas.

Regards,
Russell

Biaggio Mcphee created a Fact/Dimension table reflecting the data tables

the Lease information flow in barrel volumes from the field to RA.  Next

Yan,

The merged reports look great.  I believe the only orientation changes are to 
""unmerge"" the following six reports:  

31 Keystone Receipts
15 Questar Pipeline
40 Rockies Production
22 West_2
23 West_3
25 CIG_WIC

The orientation of the individual reports should be correct.  Thanks.

Mat

PS.  Just a reminder to add the ""*"" by the title of calculated points."

Subject:	Call with Fielder

Fielder agreed to sit down and talk as soon as we'd like.
He said that his ""legal and tariff guys"" told him that ""they're on solid ground""; but John admitted that doesn't mean that Edison ""is right.""
I told him that his lawyers and tariff people may think they're on solid ground with the PUC, but that in no way means that an appellate or (""god forbid) bankruptcy judge will concur with either Edison or the PUC.
I stressed that we weren't interested in meeting to re-hash our respective positions and that we wanted a meeting where we and they come to the table with constructive, good faith options to resolve the issue.
He said that he'd be willing to do that (though most deeply discount anything Edison says these days).
He suggested that we start without lawyers.  I said that we could do that, but that I'd have to check.
I told him that we'd try to get back to him sometime today regarding what we'd like to do.

Possible to discuss briefly?

Best,
Jeff"

Tana:  I don't know who Brad Diebner is.  However, Greg called me.  What Greg 
really needs is the ENA ""form"" of ISDA Schedule (with the utility election). 
He will also need a ""generic"" Paragraph 13.  The boilerplate can be mailed.  
Before you send, I need to chat with Mark and I'll let you know more later 
today.  Thanks.  Sara

Is it possible to get electronic file for the Enron North America and Peoples 
Energy Corporation ISDA?  Is it in Word?  I am trying to get our new JV, 
Midwest Energy Hub, to utilize our format for the template for MEH.

Thanks
Molly

Molly,

Could you send me an electronic version of the ISDA that was signed between
ENA and PEC. I understand from our attorney that we did not work with an
electronic version, only a hard copy. In order to create an ISDA template
for MEH, I need the electronic version.

Thanks

Aparna

After some major soul searching and frustration, Jose Luis and I talked last 
night and we are considering moving the date one week back to June 3 in hopes 
of avoiding a number of the problems we are currently having. 
I want to know if any of you have any major conflicts with this date and 
Linda K, as soon as the hurrican passes, will check with the Four Seasons for 
availability (which was our first choice from the beginning).
We love you all and I'm hoping this doesnt' change anyone's schedules too 
much.
Love, Liz
p.s. Sharon, if you talk to the Four seasons, can you check on that date.
Thanks"

I guess Paul Choi spoke with Melissa Murphy when she was up here and told her 
the language looked fine on this confirmation. He reiterated that, and I'll 
fax the initialed copy back to you.

Thanks,

Mark, I wanted to get back to you on your questions and also give a little 
more detail of the analysis.  As you know, we have issues in Canada about 
taking cash collateral, which issues have been clearly identified and 
communicated by Peter previously (see his e-mails of March 20, 2001).  
However, as opposed to cash, it appears clear under our personal property 
registration legislation that a certified cheque and a bank draft would fall 
under the definition of ""instruments"".  Under such legislation, as Peter has 
indicated below, a security interest in ""instruments"" can be perfected by 
possession, thus eliminating the need to register the security interest at 
the personal property registry, which requirement to register creates the 
perfection and priority concerns we have with holding cash collateral.  
Therefore, at first blush, it seems that a counterparty providing a certified 
cheque or bank draft to us (in lieu of cash collateral or a letter of 
credit), which certified cheque or bank draft would be held by us in the same 
manner as we hold L/Cs, might solve our cash collateral concerns and make 
another credit instrument available to us for use in Canada.

There are a few concerns, which I think are raised by your questions.  The 
first is that, if we take the instrument and immediately convert it to cash 
and place the cash in an account, we run into the exact same issues as we 
have with taking cash collateral in the first place.  The personal property 
security legislation specifically indicates that proceeds realized from 
dealing with the original collateral need to be perfected in the same manner 
as original collateral of the same kind (ie. where the proceeds from the bank 
draft are cash, we need to then perfect our security interest in the cash as 
if the original collateral was cash, meaning we have the exact same issues as 
we currently have with perfecting a security interest in cash collateral).  
Therefore, we would need to deal with the instrument (bank draft or certified 
cheque) in the same manner as we deal with L/Cs.  That is, we would cash the 
instrument in payment of outstanding accounts at the time that we become 
entitled under the contract to apply our collateral against amounts owing to 
us from the counterparty.  We would have to actually hold the certified 
cheque or bank draft until such entitlement arose.

The requirement to hold the bank draft or certified cheque for a potentially 
extended period of time raises another concern about how long such an 
instrument can remain outstanding before it becomes ""stale dated"" and thus 
undrawable.  In other words, it may well be that a bank will only allow such 
instruments to be drawable if they are presented for payment within a 
reasonable time of their issuance.  This is one point that would require 
further research if we are going to consider utlizing such instruments as 
collateral, since the answer could obviously make the use of such instruments 
a solution for only very short term transactions, if at all.

The final point I would make is also raised by your second question below.  
My understanding is that the law in Canada has been somewhat grey in the past 
with respect to whether a person who issues a certified cheque (or the bank 
on which the certified cheque is drawn) can stop payment on such a cheque 
after it has been issued.  I believe that there may have been some recent 
Ontario decisions indicating that a cheque, once certified, must be honoured 
upon presentment and if the bank upon which the certified cheque is drawn 
refuses to pay, it will be liable for the amount.  However, we would need to 
look into this point further, as any risk that a certified cheque can be 
withdrawn by the payor at any time after it has been issued obviously 
eliminates the benefit of the collateral.  I do not believe that the same 
concern exists for a bank draft, as I believe it represents a fully funded 
obligation of the bank to pay, which is irrevocable.

If we wish to consider using such instruments as an alternate form of 
collateral, I would suggest that we have such use vetted by outside counsel 
and obtain an opinion as to the viability and risks associated with such 
use.  Since Stikeman Elliott provided our opinion with respect to cash 
collateral, I would suggest that we use them to provide the advice on these 
points as well.  Please let me know if you would like me to instruct outside 
counsel to proceed.

Thanks
Greg

Subject: Re: Cash Collateral  

Sounds like a great idea.  a couple of questions:
Can we convert the draft into cash and still maintain our security interest?  
If not, can we get the bank to somehow guarantee that the funds will be there 
- in the US that would require either certification by the bank of the 
customer's draft or the issuance of an actual bank or cashier's check.

		 Subject: Cash Collateral

Greg Johnston may have a solution to the limitation on Canadian cash 
collateral.  Without getting into detail, a security interest in an 
""instrument"" can be perfected by possession under the Personal Property 
Security Act, and an ""instrument"" includes a bank draft.  If counterparties 
were to provide bank drafts on the same terms as they provide LCs we could 
rely on perfection by possession.  Is this something we should investigate 
further?  Peter.

The Dunn Committee will be taking up the contempt citations again on Tuesday, 
July 10.  We are currently contemplating two actions.   First, we intend to 
offer to produce some documents, most notably the ISO bid data sought (which 
the Committee already has anyway).  Secondly, as we do not expect this 
voluntary partial production to placate the Committee, we are preparing an 
action to file in federal court in Sacramento on Monday challenging the 
subpoena to the extent it seeks to require the production of documents other 
than those we offered to produce.  Robin Gibbs and Mike Kirby are on board 
with this.  Please let me know if would like any additional information about 
these matters.  Thank you.

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Well, it looks like the 18th is good for everybody, although I may be a
little late or have to leave early, depending on when we meet.  Noon works
best for me if that is alright with everyone.  I would suggest somewhere
around the Bank One or Shell buildings as the most central to all.
Restaurants around there include Zydeco, Beck's Prime, a Chinese place in 2
Shell, or Luther's.  Let me know your preference.

I agree with Brian.  I recently learned that someone can ""hack"" into the 
emeet site and pretend to be Jeff Skilling (as I discussed with you, Brian, 
this morning).  So, we probably should start with that group to see if there 
are any gaps in the email system.  

I would suggest that someone from Net Works -- Roberto DeLeon or his crew-- 
would be the appropriate technical support for this endeavor.  I agree with 
Brian that the focus should be on the impersonation of the office of the 
chairman and not the content of the email itself.

I am happy to assist in any way you would like.

David:

 I am less concerned about the substantive comments of the message as I am 
about the ""forgery"" of the ECT OTC mailbox.  Unless Michelle or another 
opines differently, I believe it is incumbent upon us to determine who 
mis-used that e-mail address.  This is not to say that an employee should be 
disciplined for raising complaints; obviously that would be retaliatory in 
nature.  And so, if this person had simply left an anonymous voice message or 
old-fashioned letter with OTC, I would have no issue.  But, here, this person 
has sent a communication ostensibly from ECT's OTC and apparently has access 
to do so in the future.  In my mind, that activity must be addressed and 
ceased.

 I suspect that it is technologically feasible to determine the source of the 
message.  Unless there is objection, I would recommend an investigation 
(which my group can do) to determine the author.

Subject: Performance Review Process

After having lived through another PRC process, it has become exceedingly 
obvious that there are several issues that need improvement in the process.  
With all our discussions about Communication within Enron, I am now 
communicating to your level issues that I have communicated in years past to 
other parties without change.

1)  Enron needs to lay out the groundrules in total that will pertain to the 
upcoming review period and communicate them in advance of the review period, 
not during the PRC process to be applied after the performance has already 
occurred and upon which each employee cannot change their behavior for such 
review period.  This is only fair to our employees so that they know the 
criteria upon which they will be evaluated in advance.

2)  The PRC system needs to be changed whereby any and all people that are 
willing to provide input on performance of any individual can be done without 
a bunch of red tape.  There is this idea that unsolicited input works within 
the system, but it requires too much effort to get throught the hurdles and 
it still requires that the supervisor approve such input.  There needs to be 
an unobstructed communication line for this input.  The theory of upward 
feedback should also be questioned.  I have never been asked to provide input 
to my direct boss (President of Houston Pipe Line) in all the years that I 
have worked for that position.  Are Managing Directors exempt from this 
process?  This issue is also addressed in #3 below in a different manner.  
How can appropriate feedback be given if those that work directly with 
individuals are not given the opportunity to communicate?

3)  There is still way too much preferrential selection of reviewers in the 
process.  There should be set out for each employee a listing of absolute 
minimum reviewers (certain people) that must be solicited, depending upon the 
job function.  I have seen too many circumstances where the obvious people to 
provide input were not even solicited.  There was one individual that 
partially worked directly for another during this past review period and was 
not even asked for input.

4)  What constitutes an average employee and what that category is within our 
PRC definitions is still being debated.  It has been described by several HR 
representatives that it is either/and both Strong or Satisfactory.  Neither 
one of the definitions describes such performance as ""simply doing the job"".  
Because of such confusion, the reviewers when they provide input do not 
effectively and precisely rate the employee.  What we end up with in the PRC 
is an over-inflated representation of each employee and the committee has to 
pull the entire group back a notch.  With better definitions and 
communication to our employees on how to interpret the definitions, it will 
give us a better process and set the standards in writing that seem to be 
lacking.

Thanks for your listening ear.

Good morning. My name is Nancy Turner, and I have recently joined Kristin Walsh's competitive analysis group where I follow gas industry issues. 

As you may recall, earlier this summer we informed you that El Paso's line 1110 had been brought down for repair, pigging and OPS review.  Our sources at El Paso and OPS have indicated to us this week that line 1110 is expected to come back online on September 1st.  We understand that the throughput on the entire system at that time should be at least 920 Mmcf/d (same as before it went offline). However, there is a strong possibility that OPS may grant the system permission to return to it's full capacity at 1.1 Bcf/d on September 1st.

We are trying to obtain more information on the capacity issue and hope to have this confirmed early next week.  We will keep you posted, but if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at X 51623 or Kristin at X 39510.

Should we attempt to serve GPU through the 21st of January.  We have a nice in-the-money contract with them in PJM.  If we don't serve, why wouldn't we use Dec. 21st as the termination date?

Subject:	Terminations by Wabash Power, GPU Energy, Ameren

(1)  I've reconfirmed through Documentation that Wabash's termination, (stated to be effective Dec 19, 2001) was as to all wholesale power transactions between EPMI and Wabash.

(2) GPU Services has delivered a notice of termination as to all transactions with EPMI. We will be treating all wholesale power Transactions with GPU as terminated but have not had to make a final concluision as to the effective date of such termination. (They've sought to make their terminations effective Dec.21, 2001, though they had to give us a month's notice on the agrement by which EPMI sells to GPU, so that termination weffective date would be January 21, 2001.)

(3) Ameren Energy Inc. has sent us a notice of termination dated December 18, 2001, which appears to be a termination and calculation of settlement payment as to all transactions with Enron Power Marketing, Inc. -- I am trying to obtain a verification on the breaadth of this termination notice.

Ed --I'll send you copies of these termination notices for your reference. -David

Elizabeth Sager indicated that Wabash has given appropriate termination notice on all transactions associated with the EEI. I will confirm with David Portz to make sure their termination notice covers any one off contracts in the event they exist.

Are there any one off contracts and does the Wabash termination notice cover if there are? Please advise."

David,

Could you please provide a description of all Insurance Policies held by 
North Carolina Power Holdings, LLC.  for the purposes described below; I'll 
forward you the lastest draft of the SPA so that you can see how ""Transferred 
Insurance Policies"" is defined.  

Also, could you please list ""all"" insurance  that is held for the benefit of 
NCPH under Enron Corp., ENA or other entity programs.  If you know, it would 
also be helpful to have an idea what insurance coverages Jerry Cambell's 
operating company has obtained to cover the plants and properties that NCPH 
and its subsidiaries (Elizabethtown Power LLC and Lumberton Power LLC) own.  
This will help with negotiation of the Exhibits, Schedules and ancillary 
agreements.

Thanks

Dear MAPP Schedule F Transmission Customers,

The Miles City DC Tie Policy has changed as of January 30, 2001.

Effective 12:00 Noon, 01/31/2001

The Policy for submitting requests for transmission service to the
WAUW.MPCO, WAUW.WACM service points under MAPP Schedule F:

Until further notice, the following policy affects requests for transmission
service to the subject service points submitted between 12:00:00 noon and
12:05:00 p.m. Central Time shall be observed.

If more than five (5) requests are submitted by the same Transmission
Customer or group of Affiliated Transmission Customers within the specified
time period to either one of the service points then all such requests shall
be considered as invalid.

MAPP will set the status of all such invalid transmission requests to
INVALID.   (For example, Six requests to WAUW.MPCO submitted between Noon
and 12:05 p.m. by the same Transmission Customer or group of Affiliated
Transmission Customers would have ALL (6) set to INVALID.

In addition the policy is posted under the MAPP Schedule F OASIS page, and
then click on OASIS Business Practices.

The URL below will also take you there:
http://mapp.oasis.mapp.org/documents/MAPP/noondctieupdate_013001.html

Please contact the MAPP Transaction Coordinator if you have any further
questions.

Sincerely,

MAPP Transaction Coordinator

This is the response I put together for Louise.



This may be better done in person.  If so, give me a call when you have time.

Here is my vision of the two worlds - Enron and Commodity Logic.



There are two basic alternatives:

If you see Commodity Logic as an independent venture, then we should build-in 
independence in our communication of deal data.  The ""Transaction Store"" does 
this.  Beth's DriveTrain project being led by John Simmons will provide 
this.  In this model, not every function/system currently performed will be 
supplanted by a Commodity Logic module.  Complete reliance on Commodity Logic 
to provide deal data needed for these systems would certainly complicate the 
integration as Commodity Logic may reside outside the firewall.   The 
systems/functions we don't think we'll outsource to Commodity Logic are: 
Trade Capture, Contracts, Valuation, Credit, and SAP functions.  
Additionally, we would like to see the development of more reporting support 
for the DPR, Operations Pricing Model, EnTelligence, and SAP Warehouse data; 
the implementation of a workflow, issue-tracking tool; and an Enron-branded 
site for Customer Information.   This vision was arrived at by asking the 
question: ""What would you never consider outsourcing, either due to 
competitive advantage, control issues, or confidentiality?""
I started shopping this vision around last week and will continue to do so 
this week to get feedback for finalization.

If the two are really one and will be managed as one going forward, then 
certainly a single deal database could suffice.  In this case, there should 
not be separately managed IT functions as redundant development efforts may 
occur and we could focus the resources on the top priorities.  Right now, 
Commodity Logic is heavily dependent upon Beth's resources to provide the 
data from the legacy systems.  The work to do these data feeds competes with 
other priorities currently underway such as Unify Performance, Alberta Open 
Access for Power, etc.  I think it is important to note that we have two 
different requirements for deal data.  One - to support Commodity Logic 
functions - is transactional and near-realtime in nature.  The second - to 
support reporting functions is probably a batch end of day process.  The 
technical design of the two would be different to meet functional and 
performance requirements.  So, in a combined world, there would still 
probably be two sources of deal data, one present on our network as separate 
messages for each deal that transactional systems build a listener to 
subscribe to and  a second source in a warehouse for reporting.

Either alternative can be approached, however organizational alignment and 
priorities might be different.  Further, if the intent is to break Commodity 
Logic off into a separate entity, then the first alternative is preferred to 
maintain arms-length independence. 

Another alternative is to consider Operations and Commodity Logic as a 
combined entity that is separate from Enron that offers systems and 
back-office services to Enron and other industry players.  I think this may 
be what Sally is envisioning.  If this is where we are headed, then some of 
Beth's resources that are directly tied to support of Operations' systems 
should be combined with Commodity Logic resources so we can have a focus on 
coordinated priorities.  I believe this alternative has the same issues as 
the first in terms of what is outsourced, e.g. becomes part of Commodity 
Logic, and what remains proprietary and confidential to Enron.

Let me know your thoughts.

Ben, please find attached the preliminary O&M estimate for the Lincoln, NE 
project that we discussed. It shows O&M cost estimates for a 20 year period 
assuming a stand alone plant with Availability required Monday - Friday, 6 am 
to 10 pm during the peak seasons (hence 2 operating shifts of staff). The GT 
major maintenance accrual is also shown assuming no membership in the Lease 
Engine Membership program. Since we will be buying the output of the plant 
from the Owner & Operator (LES) during a contract period, we may consider not 
showing them these numbers. Before tipping our hand, I'd like to see what 
they plan to ""charge"" us for the O&M portion of the power they provide us 
during the agreement period. Please review these and the other assumptions to 
ensure that I understand the project correctly at this point (especially the 
water treatment part). 


Since its preliminary in nature, please consider its accuracy +/- 25% for our 
proforma purposes.

If LES is to provide what they feel the O&M would be, please let me in on 
their numbers so we can provide our experience.

thanks, Scot"

Dynegy Seems To Have Options In Enron Deal
By Rebecca Smith and Robin Sidel
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

With the stock market telling Dynegy Inc. that energy trader Enron Corp. is=
n't worth even half what Dynegy has offered to pay, analysts and investors =
are paying close attention to the circumstances under which Dynegy could ba=
rgain a lower price or even walk away from the merger deal.=20
Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy offered to buy its far larger cros=
s-town rival in an all-stock deal that currently values Enron shares at $10=
.85 apiece, or a total of about $9.2 billion. But in the wake of post-agree=
ment disclosures by Enron that its future earnings are likely to be substan=
tially less than expected, the company's stock has been hammered. In 1 p.m.=
 trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Enron shares fell 30 cen=
ts to $4.71. The stock is down 94% so far this year and far short of the pe=
r-share takeover price. Dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $40.40.
Although Dynegy and Enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under=
 the terms negotiated, Dynegy does appear to have other options. The agreem=
ent with Enron contains a broad ""material adverse change"" clause as well as=
 some specific trigger points that could be invoked.=20
Dynegy officials performed ""due diligence"" throughout the holiday weekend, =
seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of Enron, which has suffe=
red a series of damaging blows. Since mid-October, Enron has disclosed that=
 some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved=
 assets off Enron's balance sheet, for a time, to several private partnersh=
ips. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n investigation. Past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an ""=
accounting error"" by Enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since O=
ct. 16. At one point, Enron restated downwards nearly five years of earning=
s.=20
An Enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the=
 deal would be completed as agreed. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the tw=
o sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk-away provi=
sions ""are broad, by design, to ensure adequate protection for Dynegy share=
holders."" Shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreemen=
t.=20
Clauses related to a ""material adverse change,"" also known as a ""material a=
dverse effect,"" have been the focus of much attention among merger professi=
onals this year, due, in part, to the stock market's fluctuations and the e=
conomic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisi=
tions.=20
But such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are c=
onsidered extremely difficult to prove. Both parties typically are reluctan=
t to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal, much the way a bride and =
groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to =
envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins.=20
Furthermore, a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views t=
hat a buyer can't easily walk away from a merger. In that case, meat-proces=
sing concern Tyson Foods Inc. sought to cancel a planned acquisition of mea=
t-packer IBP Inc. due to a drop in IBP's earnings and a write-down of an IB=
P subsidiary. But a Delaware judge refused to let Tyson cancel the pact, sa=
ying Tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of IBP's business and the =
accounting issue.=20
In a lengthy June 18 opinion, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Leo E=
. Strine Jr. wrote that "" . . . the important thing is whether the company =
has suffered a Material Adverse Effect in its business or results of operat=
ions that is consequential to the company's earnings power over a commercia=
lly reasonable period, which one would think would be measured in years rat=
her than months.""=20
That interpretation has created ripples in the deal-making community, promp=
ting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under wh=
ich deals can be terminated. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, a han=
dful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity wou=
ld qualify as a ""material adverse change,"" or MAC.=20
A key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change =
is ""whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is=
 it just a hiccup,"" says Meredith Brown, co-chairman of the mergers and acq=
uisitions group at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in New York. He adds that =
a court ""may be skeptical"" if Dynegy claimed that Enron's post-merger agree=
ment disclosures were a surprise.=20
The Enron-Dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting eith=
er side to seek termination. Enron can quit the deal if it receives a subst=
antially better offer, although it is prohibited from soliciting one. In su=
ch a case, it could be required to pay a $350 million ""topper fee"" to Dyneg=
y and its co-investor, ChevronTexaco Inc.=20
Dynegy can alter the deal if Enron faces ""pending or threatened"" litigation=
 liabilities that are ""reasonably likely"" to cost Enron $2 billion. If thos=
e liabilities hit $3.5 billion ""an Enron material event will be deemed to h=
ave occurred,"" presumably allowing Dynegy to call the whole thing off. In s=
ome situations, Dynegy would be liable for a $350 million fee, as well.=20
Karen Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said her firm doesn't believe that loss=
es arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material e=
vent. The liability must result from litigation. Currently, the company fac=
es more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by=
 officers and directors, issuing false and misleading reports and other off=
enses.=20
Deal makers who aren't involved in the combination say the steep drop in En=
ron's stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn't by itself =
give Dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force Enron to renegotiate it=
s terms. Instead, they say, Dynegy would likely have to prove that Enron's =
worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event, which could be di=
fficult in light of the company's highly publicized problems and Dynegy's f=
requent statement that it clearly understands Enron's businesses. Still, th=
ere is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow Dyne=
gy to terminate the deal if ""any representation or warranty of Enron shall =
have become untrue.""=20
Other energy companies have abandoned deals following a widening gap in sto=
ck prices that changed an acquisition premium. Western Resources Inc. of To=
peka, Kansas last week sued Public Service Co. of New Mexico seeking hundre=
ds of millions of dollars in damages after it failed to buy Western's utili=
ties. The lawsuit accused Public Service of breaching its ""duty of good fai=
th and fair dealing"" and said the New Mexico company tried to ""sabotage"" th=
e deal as the two companies' stock prices diverged. Public Service denies t=
he accusations.

The Corporation: Acquisitions
The Other Instant Powerhouse in Energy Trading
By Louise Lee in San Mateo, Calif.

11/26/2001
BusinessWeek
96
(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

It's not easy being No. 4. Despite a $35 billion merger completed in Octobe=
r, ChevronTexaco Corp. is still not one of the oil superpowers. Nor, at mor=
e than $90 billion a year in revenues, is it a scrappy little guy. So Chair=
man David J. O'Reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drillin=
g for more oil and gas.=20
Now, he may have something: a big stake in the No. 1 energy-trading company=
. Chevron Corp. has owned 26% of Dynegy Inc. since 1996, and with Dynegy's =
planned acquisition of Enron Corp., the top energy trader, ChevronTexaco is=
 making the oil industry's most aggressive push yet into this fast-growing =
business. It plans to eventually pump $2.5 billion into the combined Dynegy=
 and Enron to maintain its 26% stake, and it might raise that share. So, wh=
ile ChevronTexaco's much bigger rivals run small in-house trading operation=
s, energy trading may soon account for more than 10% of ChevronTexaco's ear=
nings. ``Chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business,'' says a=
nalyst Arjun Murti at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
The deal would certainly dovetail with ChevronTexaco's strategy of becoming=
 a more integrated energy company, with a hand in everything from pumping o=
il at the wellhead to trading natural-gas futures. By acquiring Texaco, Che=
vron picked up, for instance, a big refining-and-marketing business --which=
 should balance out the bad times in oil and gas production, says Eugene No=
wak, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``When crude-oil prices are down, they'll have=
 margin improvements on refining and marketing,'' he says. O'Reilly and oth=
er ChevronTexaco executives declined to comment.=20
Until now, Dynegy wasn't a big deal for Chevron. Chevron purchased the stak=
e for $700 million when Dynegy was still called NGC Corp., and it filled th=
ree of the 14 board seats--positions it will keep. Since then, Chevron has =
sold nearly all its domestic natural-gas production to Dynegy. The stake ha=
s been a good investment: it is now worth $3 billion, ChevronTexaco says.=
=20
Sitting on $2.9 billion in cash as of the end of the second quarter, Chevro=
nTexaco can well afford the Dynegy deal, analysts say. And they expect O'Re=
illy to use some of that to make more buys; the most likely target is a nat=
ural-gas company. Maybe it's not so bad being No. 4.

ALL EYES ON THE ENRON PRIZE If the deal holds, Dynegy will walk away with s=
ome juicy assets
By Stephanie Anderson Forest, with Wendy Zellner in Dallas, and Peter Coy a=
nd Emily Thornton in New York

11/26/2001
BusinessWeek

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

As Houston-based Enron Corp. imploded amid a dizzying scandal over its fina=
nces, few would have blamed Dynegy Inc. CEO Charles L. Watson if he had sat=
 back and gloated. After all, Watson had watched as his bigger, brasher cro=
sstown rival sniffed at Dynegy's more cautious strategy, all the while garn=
ering most of the credit for reshaping the energy-trading business.=20
Instead, Watson picked up the phone on Oct. 24 and called Enron Chairman, C=
EO, and longtime acquaintance Kenneth L. Lay to ask how he could help. Lay =
didn't respond immediately, but as Enron's stock continued to plunge and th=
e company faced a cash squeeze, it became clear what the only realistic ans=
wer could be: Bail us out.
So two days later, Lay invited Watson to his River Oaks home near downtown =
Houston for breakfast to discuss a deal. Over muffins and ``a bad cup of co=
ffee'' the next day, Watson recalls, they sketched the outlines, and by 10 =
p.m. that night, the investment bankers were called in. On Nov. 9, Dynegy a=
nnounced that it would pay about $10 billion, plus the assumption of $13 bi=
llion in debt, to buy Enron, which is nearly four times its size. The key t=
o the deal was Dynegy's immediate $1.5 billion infusion of cash to shore up=
 Enron's balance sheet and save its credit rating. The money came from Dyne=
gy's 26% owner, ChevronTexaco Corp.=20
Without that help, Enron--the seventh-largest U.S. company, based on its $1=
00 billion in sales last year--may well have faced bankruptcy. Watson says =
that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams. ``=
I don't think anybody foresaw the problems [at Enron],'' he says. ``It's be=
en incredible to watch.''=20
Watson, 51, has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment ye=
t. If he can pull it off, the new Dynegy will have revenues of more than $2=
00 billion and $90 billion in assets, including more than 22,000 megawatts =
of power-generating capacity and 25,000 miles of pipeline. It would control=
 an estimated 20% to 25% of the energy-trading market, up from about 6% now=
.=20
That would be sweet vindication for Watson's strategy. Dynegy backs trading=
 operations with hard assets such as power plants, which allows the company=
 to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer. In contrast, Enron has wo=
rked furiously to shed power plants and oil- and gas-generating fields, bel=
ieving it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expert=
ise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel, pulp, and pap=
er. IRRESISTIBLE BARGAIN. As Enron's stock slid below $9 from its August, 2=
000, high of $90, it became a bargain that Watson couldn't pass up. It woul=
d have taken years for Dynegy to build up a market-making operation to matc=
h Enron's. Its risk-management systems are top-of-the-line. Enron's commerc=
ial-services unit, which manages power supplies for corporate customers suc=
h as Wendy's International Inc., is three or four years ahead of Dynegy's, =
says Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy. Watson says he still plans to ge=
t rid of the $8 billion worth of assets Lay had earmarked for sale, includi=
ng the Portland (Ore.) General Electric plant and oil and gas assets in Ind=
ia. For the $1.5 billion, though, if the deal falls through Dynegy will hav=
e the right to Enron's prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline, worth an estim=
ated $2.25 billion. And Dynegy can walk away if Enron's legal liabilities e=
xceed $3.5 billion.=20
Watson firmly believes that Enron suffered from a crisis of confidence, not=
 a meltdown of its core business. Indeed, Enron's wholesale-trading operati=
on earned $2.3 billion last year. Says Watson: ``We know the business. We l=
ooked under the hood, and guess what? It's just as strong as we thought it =
was.''=20
But the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by Enron's accounting=
 tricks. The biggest danger for Watson is that there are other time bombs t=
icking away. Already, the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1=
997 by $591 million, or 20% of its total, to account for controversial part=
nerships involving Enron officials. The Securities & Exchange Commission is=
 still investigating. ``We believe it will take more than just a couple of =
weeks and a long-term relationship [between Watson and Lay] to do all the n=
ecessary due diligence,'' says analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities=
 Inc. Dynegy's Bergstrom counters: ``We're pretty certain that most everyth=
ing of material consideration has been disclosed.'' If not? The massive ear=
nings boost provides ``a high margin of error,'' he says. A WANNABE. Of cou=
rse, regulators may object to the concentration of trading operations. And =
Watson will have to mesh two very different cultures. Enron is known for it=
s intense, even cutthroat entrepreneurial spirit. Dynegy's operations are m=
ore conservative; some compare it to a fraternity. Dynegy's decision to iss=
ue new stock options to some Enron employees may soothe battered egos. It s=
hould help, too, that Lay decided not to take the $60 million golden parach=
ute he could have received in a buyout. As it is, Lay will not have a manag=

Dynegy often seemed to be an Enron wannabe, following it into online tradin=

CONFUSED ABOUT EARNINGS? You're not alone. Here's what companies should do-=
-and what investors need to know
By Nanette Byrnes and David Henry=20

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

In an age when giant earnings write-offs have become commonplace, it's hard=
 to shock Wall Street. But on Nov. 8, Enron Corp. managed to do it. After y=
ears of high-octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24% a year=
, the Houston-based energy company acknowledged that results for the past t=
hree years were actually overstated by more than a half-billion dollars. It=
 was confirmation of investors' worst fears. Three weeks earlier, Enron had=
 announced a big drop in shareholders' equity, sparking fears that its hide=
ously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance. Ma=
nagement pointed to a number of factors, including a dubious decision to ex=
clude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a=
 billion-dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company's=
 net worth.=20
Enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far sho=
rt of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases, b=
ut it is hardly alone. This year, Corporate America is expected to charge o=
ff a record $125 billion, much of it for assets, investments, and inventory=
 that aren't worth as much as management thought (chart, page 79). Even if =
companies don't go back and restate earnings, as Enron is doing, those char=
ges cast doubt on the record-breaking earnings growth of the late '90s.
Not since the 1930s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issu=
e--and so difficult for investors to determine. There's more at stake than =
the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers. If eve=
n the most sophisticated financial minds can't figure out what a company ac=
tually earns, that has implications far beyond Enron. U.S. financial market=
s have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build. It has made t=
he U.S. the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place =
to invest. It has also ensured ready access to capital for U.S. corporation=
s. That a company such as Enron, a member of the Standard & Poor's 500-stoc=
k index and one of the largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange, co=
uld fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnish=
ed. ``The profession of auditing and accounting is, in fact, in crisis,'' s=
ays Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now one of =
the leaders of the International Accounting Standards Board.=20
Sometimes, as in the case of Enron, fuzzy numbers result from questionable =
decisions in figuring net earnings. More often, though, the earnings chaos =
results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in the=
ir own idiosyncratic ways--and an increasing willingness among investors an=
d analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies, which appear under a variet=
y of names, from ``pro forma'' to ``core.'' (Enron offers its own such vers=
ion. Before investors untangled the importance of Enron's first announcemen=
t, its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ``recurring ne=
t income'' had met expectations.) The resulting murk makes it difficult to =
answer the most basic question in investing: What did my company earn?=20
Why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place? Because the numb=
ers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are=
 woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a co=
mpany's prospects. Many institutional investors, most Wall Street analysts,=
 and even many accountants say GAAP is irrelevant. ``I don't know anyone wh=
o uses GAAP net income anymore for anything,'' says Lehman Brothers Inc. ac=
counting expert Robert Willens. The problem is that GAAP includes a lot of =
noncash charges and one-time expenses. While investors need to be aware of =
those charges, they also need a number that pertains solely to the performa=
nce of ongoing operations.=20
That's what operating earnings are supposed to do. But because they're calc=
ulated in an ad hoc manner, with each company free to use its own rules, co=
mparisons between companies have become meaningless. ``No investor--certain=
ly not any ordinary investor--can read these in a way that's useful,'' says=
 Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. The SEC =
is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and =
perhaps restrict use of pro formas.=20
What's badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings an=
d a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income. In the end, in=
vestors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited ne=
t-income number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the othe=
r. ``OUT OF HAND.'' A widespread consensus is building to do just that. In =
early November, S&P proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when ta=
llying operating earnings. Only the week before, the Financial Accounting S=
tandards Board, the rulemakers for GAAP, had announced that they, too, woul=
d be taking up this issue. Volcker says the International Accounting Standa=
rds Board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings.=20
``Over the past two or three years, the use of creative earnings measures h=
as grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of=
 hand,'' says David M. Blitzer, S&P's chief investment strategist. ``Earnin=
gs are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they're trying to=
 evaluate a company. If people want to use an operating-earnings measure, w=
e better all know what we're looking at.''=20
Without those standards in place, the gap between earnings according to gen=
erally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to Wall Street=
 is only going to grow wider and more confusing. Look at the variance in ea=
rnings per share calculated for the S&P 500 for the third quarter: It's $10=
.78 according to Wall Street analysts as tallied by Thomson Financial/First=
 Call, $9.17 according to S&P, and $6.37 according to numbers reported to t=
he SEC under GAAP. (S&P, like BusinessWeek, is owned by The McGraw-Hill Com=
panies.)=20
The lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong. Use=
 First Call's earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively =
modest price-earnings ratio of 23 for the S&P 500. But run the numbers usin=
g GAAP earnings, and suddenly the market has a far steeper p-e of 38.=20
How did we get into this mess? Investors and analysts have been calculating=
 operating earnings for years, and for years, reasonable people could more =
or less agree on how to do it. Then came the dot-com bubble, along with inc=
reased pressure from Wall Street for companies to meet their quarterly earn=
ings forecasts. Suddenly, companies that hadn't turned a profit by any conv=
entional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants. Th=
ese customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and a=
llowed upstart companies to show a profit. ``TOWER OF BABEL.'' Pro forma fo=
rmulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter=
 within the same company, casting doubt on their validity. And these days, =
the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever. S&=
P's tallies fall between the two: S&P's numbers are more systematic than pr=
o forma, but they aren't followed widely enough to be a standard. ``Investo=
rs are facing a Tower of Babel,'' says Robert K. Elliott, former chief of t=
he American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and a retired=
 KPMG partner. ``It's not standardized, and the numbers are not audited.''=
=20
That makes it tough to evaluate a company's performance. In the quarter end=
ed on Sept. 30, Nortel Networks Corp. offered shareholders at least three e=
arnings numbers to choose from. By conservative GAAP accounting, the teleco=
mmunications giant lost $1.08 a share. The company also provided two possib=
le pro forma options: a 68 cents loss that excluded ``special charges,'' in=
cluding some acquisition costs and restructuring charges, and a still bette=
r 27 cents loss that further excluded $1.9 billion of ``incremental charges=
,'' such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivab=
les. Wall Street chose the rosiest one.=20
Confusing? You bet. Companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointi=
ng out that they're merely filling a void: Investors are clamoring for a me=
asure that gives them better insight into their company's future. The goal =
is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for th=
ose operations. ``There are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operat=
ing earnings,'' says Volcker. ``It is an effort to provide some continuity =
and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company.'' Besides, a=
s companies like to point out, they still have to report GAAP earnings, and=
 investors are free to ignore everything else.=20
There's no starker lesson in the shortcomings of GAAP than the $50 billion =
asset write-downs by JDS Uniphase Corp., the biggest charge of the year. Ne=
ar the height of the telecom bull market in July, 2000, the San Jose (Calif=
.) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor =
SDL Inc. for $41 billion in stock. When the deal closed in February, its as=
sets ballooned from $25 billion to $65 billion. But by then, shares of JDS =
and other fiber-optics makers were collapsing. To bring its acquisitions in=
to line with their new value, the company took charges of $50 billion. Desp=
ite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions an=
d involved no cash paid, GAAP required that the charges be taken out of net=
 income. So according to GAAP, JDS lost $56 billion in the fiscal year endi=
ng in June--a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past =
five years added up to only $5 billion.=20
Analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash, the charge-=
off was all about the past, a right-sizing of values that had gotten out of=
 hand. To analyze the company's prospects, they excluded the $50 billion ch=
arge. ``The accounting is not designed to make things look better but to de=
scribe what happened,'' says JDS Uniphase Chief Financial Officer Anthony R=
. Muller, ``and we'll live with the consequences, whatever they are.'' Anal=
ysts make a similar defense. ``My goal is to figure out what the business i=
s going to produce so that we can value the company,'' says Lehman Brothers=
 analyst Arnab Chanda. GLACIAL PACE. Are JDS's pro forma numbers realistic-=
-a fair gauge of JDS's ongoing operations? Right now, it's hard for investo=
rs to judge. And that's the kind of ambiguity S&P and others would like to =
eliminate. In November, S&P circulated a memo on how to standardize operati=
ng earnings. Under the proposal, operating earnings would include the costs=
 of purchases, research and development, restructuring costs (including sev=
erance), write-downs from ongoing operations, and the cost to the company o=
f stock options. It would exclude merger-and-acquisition expenses, impairme=
nt of goodwill, litigation settlements, and the gain or loss on the sale of=
 an asset.=20
When S&P applied roughly that formula to JDS Uniphase, it split the differe=
nce between Wall Street and GAAP. Because of differences in what each group=
 included in their earnings calculations, the results were chaotic. Using G=
AAP, the company lost $9.39 a share. S&P figures it lost $3.19, while the c=
ompany put the loss at 36 cents. Meanwhile, Wall Street says it made 2 cent=
s.=20
The S&P standard may make sense, but it raises the question: Where is the F=
inancial Accounting Standards Board, the group in charge of GAAP? Chairman =
Edmund L. Jenkins says FASB will be addressing the problems. Still, investo=
rs shouldn't expect any improvement soon. The pace of change at FASB tends =
to be glacial. It typically takes four years to complete a new standard. In=
 1996, for example, the board realized that standards on restructuring char=
ges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda. =
In June, 2000, the board finally issued a draft of a new standard, asked fo=
r comments, and held a public hearing. In October, 2001, the board said it =
still wasn't ready to put a fix in place. Now, the recession has set off an=
other wave of restructuring charges, and the FASB still doesn't have new ru=
les.=20
The slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden =
changes in the market. The most recent failure followed the terrorist attac=
ks on September 11. An FASB task force, unable to come up with a set of rul=
es for separating September 11 costs from general expenses, instead told co=
mpanies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item. So=
 GAAP earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a compan=
y's general performance. Many companies have nevertheless broken those cost=
s out in their unaudited press releases.=20
Many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter. Indeed, 2001 is shapin=
g up to be one for the record books. A poor economy and the devastating aft=
ereffects of September 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that a=
re unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen. But there's a gro=
wing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide=
 missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time char=
ges. The temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now, while =
investors are braced for bad news. Not only can managers sweep away yesterd=
ay's errors, but tomorrow's earnings will look even better.=20
The basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a char=
ge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to di=
stort the truth about a company's performance. Usually, big charges fall in=
to a few categories, including charges for laying off workers and restructu=
ring a company, charges for assets that have lost value since they were pur=
chased, charges for investments that have lost value, and charges for inven=
tory that has become obsolete. In a recent study, Harvard Business School p=
rofessor Mark T. Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling the=
se charges unusual. That gives them a rationale for excluding them from the=
ir pro forma calculations.=20
Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part =
of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company's earnings histo=
ry. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real s=
hareholder wealth that's been lost,'' argues David W. Tice, manager of the =
Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that's up 17% so f=
ar this year. ``It's money they spent on something no longer worth what it =
was, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. =
Whatever the reason, it's a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareh=
olders.'' Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings c=
an obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate opera=
ting earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best po=
ssible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, =
tails you lose'' school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains=
 in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in=
 its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the incom=
e statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer=
 maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell =
spokesman Michael Maher says the company's press releases and SEC filings b=
reak out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In=
 our view, the numbers are reported clearly,'' says Maher. ``It's all out t=
here for the consuming public.'' PAST PUFFERY. Many experts believe special=
 charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated. What should inve=
stors make of a company such as Gateway Inc.? Two restructuring charges in =
the first and third quarters, minus a small extraordinary gain, totaled $1.=
12 billion, or about $100 million more than the company made in 1998, 1999,=
 and 2000 combined. Which is the truer picture of its performance and poten=
tial? The write-offs or the earnings? Write-offs for customer financing are=
 another example. When Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to=
 customers by $767 million in September, it effectively admitted it had boo=
ked sales in the past to companies that couldn't pay--in effect overstating=
 its performance in those earlier periods. In addition, Nortel says booking=
 sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues. Tech companies blame=
 the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write-offs. And these are=
n't isolated examples. Peter L. Bernstein, publisher of newsletter Economic=
s & Portfolio Strategy, found that from 1989 to 1993, 20% of earnings vanis=
hed into write-offs.=20
Big charge-offs can also distort future performance. Critics contend that e=
xcess reserves are often used as a sort of ``cookie jar'' from which earnin=
gs can be taken in future quarters to meet Wall Street's expectations. Or c=
harges taken this year, for example, which is apt to be a lousy one for mos=
t companies anyway, might include costs that would otherwise have been take=
n in future periods. Prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earni=
ngs. Rules for figuring operating earnings would help, but this is an area =
that will always involve a certain amount of judgment--and therefore invite=
 a certain amount of abuse. ``People are going to write off everything they=
 can in the next two quarters because they're having a bad year anyway,'' s=
ays Robert G. Atkins, a Mercer Management consultant.=20
Part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug the=
m off, believing that with the bad news out in the open, the company is poi=
sed for a brighter future. Since Gateway detailed its third-quarter charge =
of $571 million on Oct. 18, Wall Street has bid the stock up 48%, compared =
with a 6% runup for the S&P 500.=20
Often, though, investors should take exactly the opposite message. If, for =
example, part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training, infor=
mation-technology spending, or research and development, the cuts could dep=
ress future performance, says Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at the =
Stern School of Business at New York University. ``Are these really one-tim=
e events?'' he asks. ``Or is this the beginning of an avalanche?'' Indeed, =
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. strategist Steve Galbraith has found that =
in the year following a big charge-off to earnings companies have underperf=
ormed the stock market by 20 percentage points. ``LA LA LAND.'' Investors a=
re apt to be faced with more huge write-offs next year, even if the economy=
 doesn't continue to worsen. Why? The transition to a new GAAP rule that ch=
anges the way companies account for goodwill--a balance-sheet asset that re=
flects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangibl=
e assets. Under the new rule, companies will have to assess their propertie=
s periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value=
 falls. An informal survey by Financial Executives International of its mem=
ber controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect t=
o take more charges.=20
But figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task. Unless t=
here is a comparable company or factory with an established market price, v=
aluing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules. =
``What this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors com=
ing up with their own tests for impairment,'' says the Stern School's Profe=
ssor Paul R. Brown. ``It's La La Land.''=20
While the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings gam=
es, it could also be an impetus for change--especially in the wake of the d=
ot-com fiasco. Indeed, there are some signs of a backlash. The real estate =
investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings, with its ``=
funds from operations,'' or FFO. But now some REITs have begun to revert to=
 plain old GAAP earnings. Hamid R. Moghadam, CEO of San Francisco-based AMB=
 Property Corp., shifted back to GAAP in 1999. ``The reason I don't like FF=
O is very simple,'' says Moghadam. ``One company's numbers look better than=
 another one's even if they had identical fundamental results.''=20
There are other steps FASB could take to improve financial reporting and re=
store GAAP's status. Trevor S. Harris, an accounting expert at Morgan Stanl=
ey, says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income=
 from operations and income from financial transactions. Lehman's Willens s=
ays companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they=
 bear on earnings. An easy step would be to require companies to file their=
 press releases with the SEC.=20
At the least, says Lev, companies must clearly explain how their pro forma =
numbers relate to the GAAP numbers. Otherwise, he says, investors ``see num=
bers floating there, and where did they come from?'' In today's environment=
 of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write-offs, no questio=
n is more important to investors.

High-Gloss Glossary
Companies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin =
on
their results. Here's what those terms mean:
DEFINING EARNINGS:
NET INCOME
The bottom line, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAA=
P).
Sometimes called ``reported earnings,'' these are the numbers the Securitie=
s &
Exchange Commission accepts in its filings.
OPERATING EARNINGS
An adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrela=
ted
to the ongoing business. Although it sounds deceptively like a GAAP figure
called ``operating income'' (revenue minus the costs of doing business), it=
 is
not an audited figure.
CORE EARNINGS
Another term for operating earnings. Neither core nor operating earnings ar=
e
calculated according to set rules. They can include or exclude anything the
preparer wishes.
PRO FORMA EARNINGS
The 1990s term for operating earnings. Popularized by dot-coms, it sometime=
s
excludes such basic costs as marketing and interest.
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The
granddaddy of pro forma, it was initially highlighted by industries that
carried high debt loads, such as cable TV, but has since come to be widely
quoted.
ADJUSTED EARNINGS
A new term for pro forma.
DEFINING COSTS:
SPECIAL CHARGES
A general term for anything a company wants to highlight as unusual and
therefore to be excluded from future earnings projections.
ASSET IMPAIRMENTS
Charges taken to bring something a company paid a high price for down to it=
s
current market value. Many companies are now taking these charges on intern=
al
venture-capital funds that bought Internet and other high-tech stocks at
inflated prices.
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS
The same idea as asset impairments except they're used to write down the
premium a company paid over the fair market value of the net tangible asset=
s
acquired. These charges will explode in the first quarter of 2002 because o=
f a
change in mergers-and-acquisitions accounting that eliminates goodwill
amortization and requires holdings to be carried at no more than fair value=
s.
RESTRUCTURING RESERVES
An accrued expense (not usually cash) to cover future costs of closing down=
 a
portion of a business, a plant, or of firings. These are projected costs an=
d
if overstated can later become a boost to earnings as they are reversed.
WRITE-DOWN
Lowering the value of an asset, such as a plant or stock investment. It is
often excused as a bookkeeping exercise, but there may have been a real cos=
t
long ago that now proves ill spent, or there may have been associated cash
costs, such as investment-banking fees.

AP, the generally accepted accounting principles, allow all kinds of one-ti=
me expenses and noncash charges. This obscures the performance of ongoing o=
perations. No one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there=
 are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense. The res=
ult is total confusion. Take earnings per share for the Standard & Poor's 5=
00-stock index for the second quarter. Under Thomson Financial/First Call s=
tandards, it is $11.82. But it's $9.02 according to S&P and $4.83 under GAA=
P. How can investors make intelligent decisions?=20
The Financial Accounting Standards Board clearly is failing to do its job. =
It has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings =
and relates them to net earnings, but it hasn't delivered. The rating agenc=
y Standard & Poor's (owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies, as is BusinessWeek=
) is doing a better job. It recently drew up a definition of ``operating ea=
rnings'' that includes restructuring costs (including severance), writedown=
s from ongoing operations, and the cost of stock options. It excludes merge=
r and acquisition expenses, litigation settlements, impairment of goodwill,=
 and gains or losses on asset sales. This is a beginning that FASB should b=
uild on. The accounting anarchy has to end.

Back in Enron's heyday, one of its rising stars was Rebecca Mark. Nicknamed=
 ``Mark the Shark'' because of her ferocious ambition, she made her name in=
 the early '90s building the energy giant's international operations, inclu=
ding the now-troubled Dabhol power plant in India. Once rumored to be a suc=
cessor to Enron CEO Ken Lay, she resigned from Enron in August, 2000, after=
 two years of heading Enron's ailing water company spin-off, Azurix.=20
These days, as Enron struggles to stay afloat, Mark-Jusbasche (who hyphenat=
ed her name with that of her husband of two years) is watching the action f=
rom the sidelines. And she'd like to keep it that way. ``I'm very surprised=
 and saddened by [what has happened at Enron], and I wish them all the best=
,'' she says. Beyond that, Mark-Jusbasche, 47, is not much interested in ta=
lking about Enron, which is being acquired by a small rival after a spectac=
ular Wall Street flameout. Mark left Enron with millions of dollars worth o=
f Enron shares, although she says she has sold them since.
Mark-Jusbasche spends most of her time serving on advisory boards, both at =
Yale and Harvard business schools, as well as the school where her 16-year-=
old twin sons from a previous marriage are sophomores.=20
In her spare time, she seeks out opportunities for investing. Currently, Ma=
rk-Jusbasche is considering alternative-energy and water-technology compani=
es. A farm girl from Missouri, she has one investment focus that's especial=
ly dear to her heart: looking into expanding her cattle ranches. She now ow=
ns 15 acres in New Mexico. ``I'm doing things that are fun, interesting, an=
d important to me--family and community,'' she says. Sure beats being anywh=
ere near Enron.

Schwab Chief's Main Theme: Diversification
By Lynnette Khalfani
Dow Jones Newswires

11/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- More than two months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many=
 investors remain edgy. But the stock market, after an initial selloff, has=
 shown remarkable resilience.=20
Few observers expect stock-market volatility to subside soon. Still, expert=
s say that now, more than ever, is the time for skittish investors to keep =
their wits about them.
In a recent interview, Charles R. Schwab, chairman and co-chief executive o=
f Charles Schwab & Co., the San Francisco-based online and discount brokera=
ge firm, gave his views on what investors should be doing -- and what mista=
kes they should avoid.=20
Here are some excerpts from the interview:=20
In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, how much more risk, if any, do you thi=
nk is in the financial markets? Or do you think it's just that people's per=
ceptions about risk have changed?=20
I've been investing since 1959, and I have to say that, year after year, th=
e risk hasn't changed. The risk is always there. There's risk in investing =
in stocks, bonds and even U.S. Treasuries because of interest-rate [fluctua=
tions]. There's risk in real estate, too.=20
So the question is: How do you handle it? The best way is to diversify. Ove=
r a long period of time, people who diversify their investments do pretty d=
arned well. When they don't . . . sometimes it's fatal. If the only stock a=
n investor owned was Enron . . . or Cisco at 70, that was pretty fatal.=20
What do you say to people who say they're too scared to invest right now? T=
hat because of the threat of terrorism, the anthrax scares, the war in Afgh=
anistan, the recession, and so forth, there's just too much uncertainty in =
the markets?=20
I remember back during the Cuban missile crisis, we all feared the worst. W=
e were all building bomb shelters. It was a scary time. This terrorist thin=
g is no different. It's awful -- particularly for our children. But this co=
untry is so wealthy, in terms of its resources, intellectual capital and th=
e strength of our government.=20
There is no more uncertainty today than in times past. For example, we've h=
ad many recessions. It's not fun, especially when you begin reading about a=
ll these layoffs. In fact, I think the unemployment rate [now at 5.4%] pret=
ty easily might get to 6.5% before it gets better. And it probably won't ge=
t better until March or April. Also, the stock market will go up, hopefully=
 before the economy goes up.=20
There's $2 trillion sitting in money-market accounts. That's a huge resourc=
e and buying power that's definitely available for new investments.=20
What do you think is the biggest mistake investors have made over the past =
two or so months?=20
They let their emotions take over. With the fear that people had, they didn=
't use their rational thinking. They used their emotional thinking. [After =
Sept. 11], they sold at the low, and fear was the driver.=20
Just a year and a half ago, the driving emotion was greed. You're not going=
 to avoid this stuff. So the issue is how you manage through these cycles o=
f fear and greed. Even when I'm fearful of something, I say to myself: ""Thi=
s is still the time to invest.""=20
My biggest worry right now is that people will give up and say, ""I just don=
't want to be in the stock market at all."" And it's just the time that peop=
le should be hanging on and keeping a diversified portfolio.=20
Some other mistakes: A lot of people hang on to the stock that was the post=
er child of the last cycle. Or people say, ""I'll get back in [the market] w=
hen I see the economy turn around."" Well, by the time they see that, it's t=
oo late. They will have missed the whole ride back up.

Enron Pursuing a Cash Infusion Energy: Company is seeking as much as $1bill=
ion as it tries to shore up its endangered acquisition by Dynegy.
From Bloomberg News

Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. said talks are continuing with potential investors f=
or an infusion of as much as $1 billion as the biggest energy trader tries =
to avoid a collapse of its planned purchase by Dynegy Inc.=20
An investment would ease concern that Enron's weakened finances may prompt =
Dynegy to pull out of or renegotiate the terms of the transaction, which is=
 valued at $23 billion in stock and assumed debt.
Enron is seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in cash but would=
n't divulge details. ""We are not going to discuss the particulars of who we=
 are talking to,"" Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Sunday.=20
Shares of the Houston company fell by 48% in the last three trading session=
s on the New York Stock Exchange. At Friday's closing price of $4.71, the s=
tock sells for less than half the $10.85 that Dynegy is slated to pay in th=
e acquisition. That's a sign investors are skeptical the transaction will g=
o through as planned.=20
Enron is likely to have approached Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts & Co., Blacksto=
ne Group and Carlyle Group for a private equity investment, said industry a=
nalyst David Snow of PrivateEquityCentral.Net.=20
The firms have declined to comment.=20
In a conference call Nov. 14, Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon=
 said the company is in talks with several private investors and expects to=
 receive $500 million to $1 billion from those sources.=20
On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on a $690-millio=
n note due this week, gaining more time to restructure its finances. Dynegy=
 Chief Executive Chuck Watson said he was ""encouraged"" by the commitment to=
 extend the note payment as well as the closing of a $450-million credit fa=
cility. He said Dynegy remained committed to the purchase.=20
Enron already received $1.5 billion in cash Nov. 13 from ChevronTexaco Inc.=
 as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement. In return, Dynegy received preferr=
ed stock and other rights in an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural G=
as Co. pipeline. Under the deal's terms, if Dynegy and Enron fail to merge,=
 Dynegy can acquire the pipeline company.=20
But Barron's reported over the weekend that Dynegy's right to the pipeline =
might be challenged by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc=
., which accepted the asset as collateral for $1billion in loans to Enron.=
=20
Dynegy spokesman John Sousa declined to comment on Enron's attempts to secu=
re financing or whether more cash for Enron is a condition of keeping the m=
erger alive.=20
Enron's dealings with affiliated partnerships have led to a federal investi=
gation of the company, which restated its earnings and saw its credit ratin=
gs cut.=20
The company said in a Securities and Exchange filing a week ago that it has=
 less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left.

Dynegy Optimistic That Enron Merger Will Succeed - FT

11/26/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) remains optimistic, after further re=
view of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) finances last week, that it will be able to buy=
 the company, the Financial Times reported Monday.=20
Dynegy said that it, ""remained optimistic for the potential of the merger t=
o be completed, and in the time frame we originally announced - six to nine=
 months,"" the FT reported.
Critical investment in Enron by J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup will procee=
d only if an unofficial pact between Enron, Dynegy, and Enron's lenders and=
 credit rating agencies remains intact, the report said. Investment from th=
ese two is likely to total between $500 million and $1 billion, while Enron=
 continues to look for a further $500 million from private equity firms.=20
The deal suffered a setback last week, when a regulatory filing revealed a =
greater debt burden than some investors had realized. Enron's share price f=
ell following the report, to $4.74 from $9.00.=20
A $1 billion secured credit line from J.P. Morgan Chase and an extension of=
 a $690 million repayment due Tuesday weren't enough to keep the share pric=
e from falling. This led to speculation that Dynegy was considering renegot=
iating its all-stock bid, now at $9.3 billion, compared with Enron's market=
 value of $3.5 billion, said the report.=20
Renegotiating the deal wouldn't have any impact on Enron's finances, unname=
d sources told the FT.=20
But if Dynegy pulled out of the deal altogether, there might be no cash inf=
usion from J.P. Morgan chase and Citigroup. Credit ratings agencies could t=
hen downgrade Enron's debt to junk, forcing partners to repay debts, the re=
port said.=20

Dynegy Purchase Prompts Antitrust Concerns, L.A. Times Says
2001-11-26 07:36 (New York)


     Washington, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- California Attorney
General Bill Lockyer is examining Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
acquisition of rival energy seller Enron Corp. for possible
antitrust violations, the Los Angeles Times reported.

     The California Independent System Operator, which manages the
state's electric grid, has asked federal regulators to ban Dynegy
and other major power sellers, including Mirant, and AES Corp.'s
Williams Cos., from selling electricity at market prices in the
state, the Times said.

     Throughout the state's power crisis, Governor Gray Davis and
other officials accused Dynegy, Enron and other power companies of
withholding electricity and manipulating the cost of wholesale
power to gouge consumers, the Times said.

     Enron is negotiating with bankers to restructure $9.15
billion in debt.

     ``I would hope that the people who look at the antitrust
implications would consider this one carefully,'' California State
Senator Steve Peace, a Democrat, told the Times. ``If anything,
Dynegy would be in an even stronger position to be able to
manipulate markets than it was before.''

The Enron scandal
A V Rajwade

11/26/2001
Business Standard

Copyright (c) Business Standard

Enron has always been recognised by other companies as best practice in ris=
k management. It put in systems to manage risks on a real-time basis and ha=
d very strong management."" James Lam, founder of eRisk, a consulting firm.=
=20
As an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of man=
agement of price risks, I have been an admirer of Enron's elaborate disclos=
ure of its risk management practices. And yet, in a cascade of events over =
a period of just three weeks from mid-October, it lost two-thirds of its sh=
are value, became the subject of a US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) =
investigation, and was taken over by a rival a third in size. (Latest repor=
ts create some doubt about whether this will go through.) What went wrong?
No, the events had nothing to do with Dabhol. Indeed, if, for us in India, =
Enron will always be associated with the controversial power project, elsew=
here it is likely become a case study for students of accounting, finance a=
nd general management. (On second thoughts, even its Indian adventures woul=
d make an excellent case study!)=20
But first, a recount of what happened. After announcing on October 16, with=
out much explanation or transparency, that it has taken a charge of $ 1.2 b=
illion against equity, Enron's share price started tumbling. Apparently, th=
e charge was the result of some financial transactions, and the SEC launche=
d an investigation. The chief financial officer (CFO), who was directly inv=
olved with the transactions, the company's treasurer and a couple of other =
senior officials were sacked.=20
Perhaps most damagingly, Enron revised its accounts from 1997 onwards, redu=
cing profits by about $ 600 million and increasing debt by a somewhat simil=
ar amount. As a result, Enron's credit rating was downgraded.=20
It seems the root problem was not in its basic business of power and gas tr=
ading, but in its investment activities controlled by the CFO. These compri=
sed private equity, and Enron's share in each of the investee companies was=
 kept artificially below 50 per cent to avoid consolidation of accounts. To=
 this end, outside investors were brought in and assured of equity in Enron=
 itself, should the value of the investee company(ies) fall below agreed th=
reshold(s).=20
All this was done to keep the losses in investments off-balance sheet, and =
mitigate their impact on reported profits. Many other US corporations inclu=
ding J P Morgan Chase, which had large private equity investments, have suf=
fered on this score (see World Money October 15). Enron wanted to avoid thi=
s and, last year, paid its since-dismissed CFO $ 30 million for his creativ=
e accounting genius.=20
Incidentally, those enamoured of US GAAP and its alleged superiority over t=
he rest of the world should note that all these gimmicks were blessed by th=
e company's auditors one of the Big Five firms, which was paid $ 25 million=
 as audit fees and $ 27 million for other services by Enron last year.=20
The restatement of the accounts from 1997 onwards became necessary as the E=
nron management/board and the auditors were forced, on review, to admit tha=
t at least some of the transactions should have been on, rather than off, b=
alance sheet. Details of all the transactions in question are yet to come o=
ut, but what has come out is bad enough.=20
But this apart, a billion dollar hit for a company of the size ($ 300 billi=
on) or cash flow ($ 3 billion) of Enron is, by itself, hardly a death warra=
nt. But it turned out to be just that for Enron.=20
Perhaps because it was too arrogant? Perhaps also because its accounts lack=
ed transparency and their opaqueness ensured that investors' confidence was=
 always somewhat fragile?=20
But there are two other points worth noting: the professionalism of equity =
analysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between tradin=
g and producing. As for the first, the professional analysts were surely aw=
are of the opaqueness of the accounts,but few questioned the management agg=
ressively on the subject. Perhaps the stock was too glamorous and typified =
the spirit of the times trading assets was what the ""masters of the univers=
e"" did, not the boring old business of producing oil or power or cars. The =
Enron management itself was proud of the way it operated in its principal a=
ctivity of trading in power and gas, with Skilling, the former CEO, claming=
 that ""we are on the side of angels. We are taking on the entrenched monopo=
lies. We are bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world.=
"" (The quotation is from an interview in BusinessWeek, prior to Skilling's =
inglorious exit from Enron a couple of weeks before the bubble burst).=20
For the analysts, there was also safety in numbers. Skilling claimed that ""=
Enron's operations are built around the integration of modern financial tec=
hnologies and physical technologies"", bringing derivatives theory to tradin=
g in power and gas! Obviously, the fate of Long Term Capital Management has=
 not led to more sober management of trading risks.=20
Surely the role of ""markets"" should be to reduce the distance, and cost, be=
tween producer and consumer? One does feel that there is something perverse=
 in a society that values, in terms of compensation, the trader (don't forg=
et this is just a euphemism for the speculator) over the producer whether i=
n the bond, currency or power and gas markets. The markets and, indeed, gre=
ed obviously have a role to play, but surely the pendulum needs to swing a =
little bit to the left?

India's Mehta Comments on Birla Group Offer to Buy Enron Stake
2001-11-26 03:42 (New York)

     Mumbai, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Jaywantiben Mehta, India's
union minister of state for power, comments on reports of Aditya
Birla Group, which owns Grasim Industry Ltd., the nation's third-
biggest cement maker, bidding for Enron's stake in Dabhol Power
Co.

     Enron wants to sell its 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power,
India's biggest foreign investment, at cost. The project is mired
in a tariff dispute over $64 million in bills that haven't been
paid by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its only
customer, for eight months.

     ``One more bidder will increase competition, which is
welcome.

     ``Any step in the national interest is good.

     ``Cheap energy is always in the national interest since we
want to increase electricity generation and sell it at a
reasonable price.

     ``I can't comment on the time-frame of buying out the Enron
stake until the legal wrangles are solved. Once that's cleared,
then we will try and clear the proposal quickly.''

No problem.  I got some comments from Accounting, but I'm fine if you want it 
to go out with the caveat that Enron has a couple of minor administrative 
points to clear up.

Greg W. wants us to use new phone numbers for the Help Desk, etc.

Unless I hear otherwise from you tomorrow, I will proceed with preparing our documents with the new Help Desk number.

P.S. I realise I have been emailing you a lot. Please let me know if you would like me to cut down - I'm never sure whether I'm overcommunicating or not.

Duong,

Can I get a change in Enpower?   We have done this type thing on the West desk:

For every counterparty ""Ercot Imbalance"" ,   I would like the Risk Mark to market flag set to ""off""  automatically.     When this manual process does not get done,  we have settlement problems.

What do you think?

I have decided to take another route with the ski trip.  Instead of getting
more people to go, I am thinking that it should be just us two.    Maybe we
get a nice one room cabin with a fireplace, a warm bear rug, some cocoa.
Maybe some wine and candles to create a mood.  What do you think?

At this time it appears that I will be going to NYC on Wednesday, returning 
Friday afternoon or possibly Thursday night.  I'll miss the Turbopark closing 
dinner, which is not all bad, as it will save me a lot of calories and a 
headache.  I will miss getting the pat on the back.  I didn't want to miss 
Michael's open house, though, as that was more important.

As you know, things are subjec to change.

This morning Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett held a press conference on her AB 
128x.  Several print journalists and 3 TV cameras were present at the 
conference.  Also of interest is that the Senate tax consultants and Burton's 
staff were at the event.  Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson showed up late 
and gave a few quotes to the media present.  A spokesman from Mirant also 
gave a few interviews after the press conference.
According to Corbett's staff, they expect to handout the bill amendments at 
the hearing.
Among Corbett's comments to the media present:
""This bill is not a negotiating tool.  I'm very serious about this bill.  I 
want to see it through the process.  The Governor will sign a bill like this.""
The following amendments are to be presented at the committee hearing today
as follows:
AB 128X
1) Creates a Tax on Excess Gross Receipts from Electrical Energy
Distribution (called a ""tax on excess greed"")
2) Imposes a tax on the first sale of electricity by generators and
middlemen.
3) Establishes as the measure for the tax, the amount by which the
gross receipts exceed a specified price (""the base price"").  The measure of
tax is called the excess gross receipts.
4) Creates a 3-tier system of rates as follows:
a) Sales price more than the base price but not more than 150%
of the base price, tax rate = 50%
b) Sales price more than 150% of the base price but not more
than 200% of the base price, tax rate = 70% 
c) Sales price more than 200% of the base price, tax rate = 90%
5) Creates a rebuttable presumption that the base price represents a
fair sales price.
6)  Adds a mechanism to require withholding of the tax by purchasers.
Residential consumers and small business are exempt.
7)  Requires sellers to file annual tax returns to report the tax on excess
gross receipts and pay any remaining tax due.
8)  The measure sunsets after five (5) years.
There will be a report after today's Assembly Rev & Tax Cmte hearing.
As opposed to SB 1x that returns the taxes raised to ratepayers, AB 128x 
would ""repay"" the State's General Fund.

Attached please find referenced list.  The only amended counterparty with a 
change was Murphy Exploration which was shut down for power.  I wonder, when 
we are working with amended counterparties, if there is some way that my 
prior approval could be on the recent spread sheet?  Right now I have to go 
find the old spread sheet to find out what I approved it for last time to see 
if I have any problem with the change.  So usually, unless I have - change 
next to amended, it means I had no change to what I said before.  Does that 
make sens?

Our Mothers were best friends when we grew up in C.B.   His mother loved us and that created some competitive spirit between us.  I beat Jeff in 6th grade in a run for student Council at Hoover.   We were friends but didn't really like each other if that makes any sense.  Personally, I quit hanging out with him when he wanted to always take our shirts off and wrestle on his sisters bed.  I thought he was a little weird.  He did show up to Mitch's visitation which meant alot to me.  I would support Siegrist.  Do not forward this to anyone.

Subject: VEPCO Information Request

To all:

In our last meeting with VEPCO we presented a structure that would 

1).  Allow Enron to sell the Edgecombe plant to VEPCO at a fixed price at the 
end of the term of the PPA (around $325/kW)
2).  Allow VEPCO to buy the plant from us at a fixed price at the end of the 
term of the PPA (around $425/kW).

This structure caps our downside risk into a quantifiable number (it also 
limits our upside but we're willing to give that up to protect against a big 
negative hit).


In order to evaluate this structure, VEPCO has asked for some specific plant 
information.  We have most of this info in various forms and I would like 
your help pulling it together.

1).  Full plant description (equipment, design, drawings)
2).  Construction costs (have we gotten updated NEPCO numbers for this 
project?)
3).  Permits (timeline for obtaining, run hours allowed on both natural gas 
and fuel oil, emission limits)
4).  Fuel contracts (in process).

Please let me know what you have and an estimate on timing to get the rest of 
the request.

If we can negotiate this structure with VEPCO, we will make a significant 
jump in getting the internal okay to move forward.

Thanks for your help,

Heather

From additional conversations with the Ed Duncan and Mike Day --
 
It looks as if WE ARE REQUIRED TO SEEK A STAY/REQUEST FOR REHEARING FROM THE CPUC BEFORE WE CAN FILE WITH THE COURTS.    We also have to include ALL our points in the CPUC filing or we CANNOT bring them up with the courts.
 
To be able to get to court ASAP, we will want to file Friday AM, presuming a Thursday pm vote for a July 1 or other retro date.
 
That means we need to line up all the joint parties AND get them to file declarations identifying their ""irreparable harm"".
 
I am working with Jeremy Blachman to see if can get some customers to sign on and with other ESPs -- I have a few who have agreed so far.
 
The attorney is preparing pro-forma declarations that each company/customer would file under protective seal.  We need to identify who at Enron would be filing this and get it going.  Arter and Hadden is preparing a draft as we speak and I'll be able to get it out right away.
 
Meanwhile, Dan Douglass will be working on preparing the CPUC filing, which will be developed from the court pleading we were working on.
 
Please let me know ASAP.

Subject: RE: Revised Petition and Points and Authorities


I am attaching the Joint Petition which assumes that a direct access customer joins Enron.
 
The draft is considerably improved over the draft sent yesterday but it does not take in the comments below.  These will be reviewed and integrated into the next draft.
 
I am very concerned about the exhaustion of remedies problem.  The jurisdictional statute is PUC section 1768(a).  This provision suggests that an aggrieved party must seek a rehearing before the PUC before seeking review by the Supreme Court.  A request for rehearing must be made within 15 days after the PUC acts, but there is no time within which the PUC must act.  If the PUC agreed to stay the Order, then it seems clear that a rehearing must be sought before applying to the Supreme Court.  If the PUC refuses the stay request, then there is a good argument that one of the exceptions to the exhaustion of remedies would apply.  This will require that one or all of the Petitioners request a stay by the PUC.  Douglass indicates that a stay would be unusual and that such requests normally are not made.  In this case, it is probably necessary to circumvent the exhaustion issue.  EWD 


>>> JBennett <JBennett@GMSSR.com> 09/10/01 11:19AM >>>

Sue --

I have reviewed the Petition and associated Memorandum.  A couple of general
comments:

1.  We make the point throughout (page 2 is the first time) that the
Commission's action (retroactive suspension) will result in a windfall to
the UDCs as they will be paid for services provided by Enron and other ESPs.
It is not clear to me that we can make this argument.  The commission's
order does not indicate that the ESPs have to pay the UDCs the amounts that
they have received from their direct access customers for the past two
months for energy procurement.  The commission could just as easily decide
that although customers who entered into DA contracts after July 1 are no
longer allowed to continue on DA, they will not go  back and undo
transactions that have already occurred.

2.   In the section of the memorandum discussing why the petition is
properly before the court (Section IV), we are discussing why an application
for rehearing is unnecessary.  We state that in this case a rehearing would
be superfluous and unnecessary as ""there are no new legal arguments and no
additional evidence to be presented.""  Such argument appears to run counter
to our contentions that because of the lack of hearing in this proceeding,
the Commission's decision lacks the support it needs or, on the flip side,
denied us the opportunity to put on evidence to show the suspension of
direct access was unnecessary.

3.  In section VI. (e) of the Memorandum arguing that the impairment of
contracts ordered by the Commission is not reasonable or appropriate, we
state that the Commission's motive is not the announced purpose, that its
purpose instead is malevolent as illustrated by the rhetoric directed at out
of state energy  companies.  I don't think such an argument adds anything
and, although it maybe true, at this stage it probably is not a good idea to
assert that the Commission is purposely hurting the state to get back at the
out of state energy companies.

Attached is the revised Petition and Points and Authorities (the Sept. 8
Draft"").  This draft has not been redlined because the changes and additions
are extensive.  Future revisions will be redlined.

This draft will be revised to clarify the arguments, toi nclude page
references to the exhibits, to include missing authorities, and to eliminate
typos, etc.

The argument is that the Commission acted contrary to state and federal
constitutional guaranties (a de novo standard of review) and that the
Commission acted in excess of its authority and contrary to law therebya
busing its discretion (a substantial evidence standard of review).

You will be provided a revised draft by noon on Monday (Sept 10) which I
anticipate will be substantially complete.  As soon as it is available, I
will send it to you.  At that time do you want it also sent to the
addressees listed in ypur Friday Email?  EWD

Gerald, thanks for the quick turn around.  The changes look good to me and, 
if they are acceptable to ENA and Calpine, I think ECC is in a position to 
execute (subject to Eric's final review).

Thanks

Greg

Stephanie,  Attached is a further revision of the Capacity Release Doc.  The 
comments are from counsel in the Calgary office.  All the comments are 
consistent with the intent of the prior documents.  They mainly make the 
Canada section symmetric to the ENA section.  Please review.

FYI,
Based on consultation among MAIN staff and with the MAIN PC chair as well as the chair of the newly form MAIN Security Working Group, we will take or have taken the following actions in the interest of bulk power system physical security:
1) All data on the MAIN home page formerly considered ""public"" but now deemed to have the potential to be used in sabotage acts against the interconnected electric systems is no longer available for immediate download.
2) Those entities who have a valid, regular use of such data will be given password access. Current MAIN homepage passwords will work and anyone who has OASIS access via TradeAgent will automatically have access via the the links provided on the OASIS after log-in.
3) Anyone who has a valid but infrequent use of such data will be screened before such data is supplied. This will be done through validation of phone and/or street address as well as company affiliation as necessary. In short, we will know the person who has asked for data.
4) Instruction and/or forms will be available on the web to facilitate item 3 above.
5) A modest charge to accomplish item 3 may also be required.
At a minimum the following formerly public data is included in this protected group:
- All MAIN electric system maps
- Detailed capacity reports such as the 411/860
- Parts of the FERC 715 submittal
- Detailed roster information
- outage listings
- seven days or older ATC cases
- Transmission Assessment reports (TASG, FSSG)
- All other power flow cases (MDB, MMWG, etc.)
I recognize that reports such as the 411/860 and FERC 715 also reside publicly on the FERC/DOE sites. Efforts will be made to have such data removed from the government sites as well and, I understand that FERC yesterday has already taken such action.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any question.

Hunter,

IHS
We met with IHS this morning to discuss the data that we need to complete our supply forecasts.  It is our intent to use the monthly historical production data in combination with well completion data, rig counts, and drilling permits to build a more accurate production forecast.  We need complete well characteristic data (depth, basin, age) in order to be accurate.  

In order to reach the goal above, we need to invest in two data services from IHS:

	US Production data - monthly volumes from all wells in the US updated on a lag of 1-6 months - $159,500/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly
	US Well data - well characteristics updated monthly, data age is only limited by CD-ROM delivery - $154,000/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly

Next year, we will be able to cut the US Well data and add Scout Express, which will cut the cost by $115,500.  Scout Express has only one year of historical well data, so it does not currently meet our needs.  We will be able to do this after we build the historical well information into our supply forecast.

Danielle Marcinkowski is working with IHS on the contract for the data, she is going to try and negotiate the price this afternoon.  She anticipated having the contract today, and sending it to Chicago for approval.

PIRA
Danielle is working to finalize the agreement in the next 3 days.  I gave her a list of the services that we needed, and told her that we would like to distribute the PIRA material on the Commodity Fundamentals website instead of having individual user accounts.  Based on the services that I think we'll need (North Americal Natural Gas, North American Electricity, and the Daily Demand Forecast), our combined cost for Gas and Power in Houston, Portland, Calgary, and Toronto should be around $100,000 for 100 users.  Danielle is going to send an e-mail when she has the final price.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Chris"

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments:

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to ""help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record"".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying ""show me"" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said ""FERC--just get it done""....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the ""there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree...""


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599"

Steve,

I submitted my evaluation. General impression was rather
negative: he seems to be a consultant type person
who speaks about everything with confidence  but is short on depth
and technical details.

He is personable, outspoken, organized - on the positive
side.

Also, the red flag is that he jumps from job to job: typical after
18-24 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness.

Vince

Hi Vince,

what did you think of David Hsu?

My thoughts.

Overall a good guy. Personable. Intelligent.

He could communicate reasonably well, but seemed to be capable of losing 
objectivity in favour of technical advancement.

He didn't seem comfortable with taking a man-management role (at least he 
didn't want to be an 'administrator')

He appeared to know a lot about risk. (In fact Jay Web called me to say he 
felt David was one of the better risk guys he had seen but also commented 
that he needed to be coupled with a project manager to be successfull).

regards

Steve

DATE: ??????????? July 19, 2000
 
RE:?????????????????? Contract Approval, AFEs and Consulting Arrangements

??????????? The following guidelines must be followed for all existing 
projects, as well as new contracts, AFEs and consulting arrangements.? 
 Contract Approval
??????????? Effective immediately, all contracts must be approved by legal, 
with the final version of the contract initialed by legal prior to 
execution.? Exceptions will be limited to the execution of crude oil 
purchases and sales contracts that are on a pre-approved form and occur in 
the normal course of business.? Any other exceptions must be approved by the 
Office of the Chairman.? In order to ensure that we have a handle on existing 
contracts, please provide a copy of any finalized contract which legal did 
not initial prior to execution, but is currently in effect or not yet 
performed, to Molly Sample by July 25, 2000.? 
AFEs
??????????? Based on my review of the latest AFE report, EOTT needs to 
utilize this tool to better manage all of its expenditures for budget 
purposes to ensure proper prioritization of EOTT's cash.? Company policy 
requires that all expenditures greater than $5,000 that relate to expansion 
capital and maintenance capital are required to have an AFE set up prior to 
any expenditure.? I have asked the property accounting group to monitor 
compliance with that policy starting today and hold for payment any 
expenditures not authorized according to the policy.? Effective immediately, 
all employees will be prohibited from starting any project that does not have 
an approved and signed AFE.? In addition to ensuring that the current policy 
is strictly adhered to, the policy will be broadened to include a) 
expenditures for environmental expenses captured on the EMS Works system and 
b) the use of blanket AFEs for small recurring asset purchases such as 
computer equipment (computer equipment under $5,000 would be capitalized 
under these blanket AFEs and no longer expensed).? 
??????????? In order to more accurately monitor existing AFEs, please be sure 
the following steps are taken for each AFE prepared by your department:? 1) 
obtain competitive bids prior to starting a project; 2) all projects for 
which costs are projected to exceed the approved AFE by 10% or $50,000, 
whichever is less, must have a supplemental AFE prepared and submitted for 
approval within 30 days of the projected budget overrun, and 3) any project 
that is in process and does not have an AFE must be put on hold until an AFE 
can be approved, and 4) any open AFEs that are fully completed (meaning all 
invoices have been received and routed for payment) must be closed.? A final 
capital and maintenance budget for all authorized (and still open) AFEs will 
be completed and distributed by July 25, 2000.
 ??????????? Please consult Joe Richards for information necessary to utilize 
the AFE System for all future AFE processing or for a copy of the AFE policy.
 Consulting Contracts and Service Contracts
 ??????????? Effective immediately, no new consulting arrangements may be 
entered into or extended without the approval of the Office of the Chairman.? 
Additionally, Human Resources/Administration must be contacted prior to 
entering into any consulting arrangements to 1) arrange for office space, if 
necessary for the project, and 2) to determine how the position should be 
filled (contract position, temporary employee, or permanent employee).? For 
all existing consulting agreements, please provide me with a comprehensive 
listing by arrangement, including terms and business rationale, by July 25, 
2000.? Please contact Molly Sample to prepare a contract for any undocumented 
consulting arrangements.? Written documentation on all consulting/contracting 
arrangements must be maintained by Human Resources in the event of any 
governmental agency audit of EOTT's contract employees. 
 ??????????? Contractors who provide various services, such as trucking, 
environmental cleanup, maintenance, etc. must execute a service contract and 
maintain a valid insurance certificate to remain on EOTT's approved 
contractor list, which is available on EOTT's Intranet.? Requests for service 
contractors must be sent to John Zimmerman in the Legal Department.? Please 
forward a request for contract to John for any service arrangements which are 
not documented by July 25, 2000.

Accounts Payable Documentation
??????????? Please be reminded that the Accounts Payable Department requires 
complete and timely documentation for all invoices submitted for payment.? 
This includes all charges made using a P card.? Incomplete invoices or copies 
of invoices will be returned to the submitting party.? For service contracts, 
a summary of hours, hourly rate, and a brief description of the work 
performed by person, by date, and by project, along with documentation to 
support specific authorized out-of-pocket expenses, must be submitted before 
payment can be made.? For materials, a comprehensive description of all 
items, including the quantity purchased, must be submitted before payment can 
be made.? 
 
??????????? Please notify the appropriate people in your respective 
departments of these procedures and contact me if you have any questions or 
comments.

You guys must be exhausted with all that activity.  Congratulations on the 
grandbaby.  That's a BIG deal.  My oldest ""baby"" is 20, a junior in college, 
and my Michael is 6.  Every age is special.

Thanks for the periodic updates about Michael.  He's in my thoughts, so I 
appreciate the info.  

Kay

Thanks, Kay.  Really appreciate your efforts.  

Despite Michael's problems, we did have a pretty good year as our oldest
Son was married on September 30 and the first Joyce Grandchild was born
to our Daughter on October 24.

Subject: VaR numbers for the 26th

Hi Andreas,

I have run the VaR model for the 26th July and have attached a zip file of 
the results:

The total VaR is $4,170,653 and the Cu position is $1,852,876.


I have had trouble getting hold of you so I thought I would summarised what I 
wanted to talk about (also I thought 
I would give your ears a rest!)
Basically it is wrt the second point in your mail yesterday (we briefly 
discussed it earlier). 
The fax you sent me to explain the risk calculation suggested that you use a 
5 day period of adjustment to calculate 
the risk (in this case it is called Capital at Risk). The VaR calculation for 
our model is for a one day holding period which means that your risk factor
will be reduced by a factor equal the sqrt(5) or 2.24. 
Since :

Old risk factor (%) =  1.65*(std of the price movement) = 3.99%
 
New daily risk factor = 3.99/2.24  = 1.78%    which actually equates to std 
of approx 1.1% a day.
I am happy with this as a estimate of the vol as the annualized spot vol we 
are showing for Cu is approx 19% which equates to approx 1.2% daily.

Using this new risk factor for the daily VaR the Cu positions would give a 
VaR (for the 19th) of approx $2m which is less that the 
figure we estimated ($3,100,568).
The other thing is that by taking net numbers we are disregarding the term 
structure of the price curve/vol curve and position 
curve and are hence collapsing everything into a one factor model which means 
that it is difficult to compare the numbers.
I hope that this helps to explain our number.

Hopefully we can talk tomorrow,
Cheers
Kirstee

Mark,

Actually, we received the originals of the partially executed NDA's today.  I 
have
countersigned for Loudcloud and placed one fully executed original to Tana's
attention in regular U.S. mail for your records.

Thanks again for your assistance on this matter.

Regards,

Kate

FYI - Here are copies of the final documents for the PGET/Avista transaction 
that are being sent out for signature tonight.  Thanks for everybody's help 
in getting this done.  I will be out tomorrow but can be reached at home 713 
853 6349 or on my cell phone 713 854 5747 and will be checking messages.   
Travis and Tracy will assist in gathering all the fax signatures and refaxing 
to all parties.

Remember - EPMI is required to wire the payment to PGET ($115,714.50) and WE 
NEED TO GET WIRE INFORMATION FROM PGET.  Also PGET must release cash 
collateral to Avista - we should follow up to make sure this happens.

Thanks again.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

ENA had a term supply contract with Energen to purchase roughly 4,485MMBTU a day at 2.60 on MRT, which Energen terminated on December the 4th, 2001.  The operator for the supply, Duke Field Services, erroneously allowed  supply to continue to flow between Dec. 4-31. ENA also failed to remove its nomination for the supply, allowing it to continue to flow to ENA's market, Oneok.  Duke Field Services would like to get paid for the gas it delivered and has offer to sell ENA the gas at a price of 2.3375 (gas daily average for MRT West Leg). 

I have spoken with David Eubanks in gas settlements and he shows ENA receiving and delivering the gas to Oneok.

 I would like to try to get the MRT issue settled as soon as possible, for I feel that it would help facilitate the Centana Storage account (approximately $2,500,000 in positive cash flow). Although Duke recognizes that it has no offset rights for the two issues, they seem to be taking their time. "

specific reason.  In addition to providing a web-based platform for=20
transactions, Enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the=20
site.  We stand ready at all times, in any market conditions, to buy and se=
ll=20
at the posted price.  This converts a =01&bulletin board=018 (the more typi=
cal=20
eCommerce concept) into a true market.  There are very few, if any,=20
competitors that can provide this capability.

We are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be=20
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies.  If we are=
=20
correct, this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for Enro=
n.

Accordingly, we are initiating a major new effort to capture this=20
opportunity.  Effective today we are creating a new business, Enron Net=20
Works, to pursue new market development opportunities in eCommerce across a=
=20
broad range of industries.  It is likely that this business will ultimately=
=20
be our fifth business segment, joining transmission & distribution,=20
wholesale, retail and broadband services.

Included in this business will be our entire IT and technology group along=
=20
with significant talent and resources in market making and finance. =20
Initially, North America will provide primary direct support for staff=20
services and back office, however, over time we will be requesting support=
=20
services from virtually all Enron units to ensure continued growth and=20
success.  To facilitate the combining of commercial capabilities with these=
=20
new eCommerce platforms, Enron Net Works will work closely with the merchan=
t=20
functions of North America, Europe, South America, CALME, Asia and Broadban=
d.

Enron Net Works will be headed by Greg Whalley, Chief Executive Officer; Mi=
ke=20
McConnell, Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff McMahon, Chief Commercial=20
Officer.  These individuals will comprise the Office of the Chairman for=20
Enron Net Works and remain on the Executive Committee of Enron Corp. =20
Replacing Greg Whalley as President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron=20
North America is Dave Delainey, who will also join Enron=01,s Executive=20
Committee.

Global Technology will remain intact but will now be a part of Enron Net=20
Works.  It will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did =
as=20
an Enron global function.  Philippe Bibi will remain the Chief Technology=
=20
Officer for all of Enron Corp. and continues to be responsible for the=20
development of worldwide technology standards and platforms.

EnronOnLine, headed by Louise Kitchen, will also remain intact and will now=
=20
be a part of Enron Net Works.  The success of EnronOnLine enables us to=20
utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets. In addition, the=

Al,

I am moving to Calgary from Houston and am wondering if Lexus has a winter wheel/tire package for the 2001 IS 300. If not could you recommend a wheel / tire dealer in Calgary who could help me find something that would work. Thanx for your time.

Vince,

I spoke with Whalley at the SA offsite and he mentioned that had (or knew of) 
a person that could bring some talent to the evaluation of an Enron merchant 
business in Japan.  I am in Sydney today, but will be in Tokyo next week.  I 
would like to speak more about this.  What time might you be available?  My

Subject: TECASO Project - Outside Counsel

Jim,

We are currently reviewing a new business opportunity with EES to enable 
EECC  to provide technical and commercial due diligence services for global 
infrastructure project financing.  If the new business opportunity receives 
approval from EES management, we see the need to retain outside counsel 
experienced in internet/web based issues.  Presently this need would be with 
the web, structuring, IP, and antitrust areas.

In an effort  to find a firm that Enron has used recently for web related 
matters, I spoke with Mark Taylor and Marianne Castano.  For Enron Online 
development, Mark used Sullivan and Cromwell and Milbank, Tweed for the 
web/trading effort and V & E for IP matters,  For a recent EES internet 
project Marianne used Vivian Polak of LeBeouf Lamb for web/transactional 
issues and V & E for IP matters.  She was very pleased with Vivian's 
support.  After discussing our specific requirements with Mark and Marianne 
and reviewing this matter with Vicki Sharp,  I spoke with Vivian briefly to 
confirm if she had the experience we needed.  I found she had exactly what we 
needed and subsequently discussed this with John Schwartzenburg.  John 
agreed. 

With your approval I would like permission to engage Vivian Polak of LeBeouf, 
Lamb for web, structuring and transactional related issues and Scott Brown of 
V & E for IP matters.  

If you should need any additional information concerning the TECASO Project 
or this request, please let me know.

Thank you,

Randy

The Rise and Fall of Enron

11/02/2001
The New York Times
Page 24, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Earlier this year, most companies would have loved to have Enron's problems=
. Californians resented the energy trading company's huge profits during th=
eir energy crisis, and Democrats in Washington raised questions about Enron=
's influence within the White House and about the cozy relationship between=
 Enron's chairman, Kenneth Lay, and Vice President Dick Cheney. Nobody seem=
ed better positioned to thrive during the Bush presidency than this Houston=
-based apostle of deregulation.=20
Wall Street was impressed with Enron's strategy of swooping into formerly r=
egulated markets to broker contracts for natural gas, electricity or unused=
 telecom bandwidth. The company was celebrated as a paragon of American ing=
enuity, a stodgy gas pipeline company that had reinvented itself as a high-=
tech clearinghouse in an ever-expanding roster of markets. Enron's push to =
force utilities into the Internet age with its online trading systems, at a=
 seemingly handsome profit, became an epic tale of the dot-com revolution.
It now appears that Enron's tale may be more cautionary than epic. Enron en=
vy has crashed, along with the company's stock price, as serious questions =
emerge about its bookkeeping. Enron disclosed earlier this month that $1.2 =
billion in market value had vanished as a result of a controversial deal it=
 entered into with private partnerships run by its chief financial officer,=
 Andrew Fastow.=20
Most alarming was Enron's reluctance to shed light on management's wheeling=
 and dealing. ''Related-party transactions,'' as the accountants call them,=
 are fraught with conflicts of interest. Though much remains to be learned =
about these transactions, their scope and lack of transparency suggest that=
 Enron may have in effect created its own private hedge fund to assume some=
 of the risk and mask the losses of its complex trading. The extent to whic=
h company insiders profited from the partnerships is not yet clear.=20
Enron has scrambled to dampen Wall Street's concerns, acknowledging its cre=
dibility problem while insisting on the health of its core businesses. On W=
ednesday it brought in William Powers, the dean of the University of Texas =
School of Law, to review the transactions. The Securities and Exchange Comm=
ission has launched its own formal investigation. Mr. Fastow was forced to =
resign, following Jeffrey Skilling, the man credited with driving Enron int=
o new cutting-edge businesses, out the door.=20
Enron's former admirers on Wall Street, mindful of recent scandals involvin=
g high-profile companies doctoring their earnings, and of the spectacular c=
ollapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998, are alarmed=
. Carole Coale of Prudential Securities summed up the prevailing sentiment =
when she told The Times: ''The bottom line is, it's really difficult to rec=
ommend an investment when management does not disclose facts.'' Analysts, a=
s well as the media, are not entirely blameless. Enron did mention, albeit =
in passing, the troubling related-party deals as early as March 2000. But f=
ew analysts bothered to raise questions at a time when the company's revenu=
es, profits and stock price were soaring.=20
Harvey Pitt, the new Securities and Exchange Commissioner, must pursue the =
Enron inquiry aggressively in order to assure investors that he will be as =
vigilant as his predecessor, Arthur Levitt, when it comes to protecting the=
 integrity of financial markets. Indeed, even if Enron is cleared of any wr=
ongdoing and regains some of its past luster, as it well might, the company=
 that preaches the merits of self-regulating marketplaces has reminded us a=
ll of the need for a strong regulator on Wall Street.

The Enron Debacle
Byzantine deals have shattered the energy outfit's credibility
Executives at high-flying Enron Corp. (ENE ) never seemed overly concerned =
with how the rest of the world viewed their business practices. Earlier thi=
s year, the California Attorney General had to get a court order to collect=
 documents in an industrywide investigation into energy price fixing. And w=
hen an analyst challenged former CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling in a conference ca=
ll to produce Enron's balance sheet, Skilling called him an ""ass----."" Stil=
l, even some Enron executives worried that the company had gone too far wit=
h two complex partnerships set up in 1999 to buy company assets and hedge i=
nvestments. With Enron's then-chief financial officer acting as general man=
ager of the partnerships and in a position to personally benefit from their=
 investments, the potential for a conflict of interest and backlash from in=
vestors seemed overwhelming. ""Internally, everybody said this is not a good=
 idea,"" says a source close to the company.

But no one could have predicted such a jaw-dropping outcome for the nation'=
s largest and most innovative energy trader. Since Oct. 16, when Enron reve=
aled a $35 million charge to earnings to reflect losses on those partnershi=
ps and was forced to knock $1.2 billion off its shareholders' equity, the c=
ompany's stock has plunged 60%. The Securities & Exchange Commission is inv=
estigating Enron's accounting for its partnerships and whether it properly =
disclosed them to investors.

Suddenly the company, which brought high-tech and complex finance to energy=
 trading, is essentially trying to avoid a run on the bank. Moody's Investo=
rs Service has already downgraded the company's debt. Enron says it is meet=
ing with credit agencies to calm their fears, and analysts say Enron is wor=
king on a turnaround plan that would likely include accelerating asset sale=
s, issuing shares, and obtaining new credit lines. Enron's board has set up=
 a special committee to look into its controversial partnerships. But analy=
sts also worry that Enron's trading partners could pull the plug if they lo=
se confidence that it can honor its trades.

""ON CRACK?"" Inside Enron, once-cocky employees are reeling. They were still=
 puzzling over the abrupt Aug. 14 departure of CEO Skilling when the compan=
y announced on Oct. 24 that CFO Andrew S. Fastow, architect of the controve=
rsial private LJM investments--which got their name from the first initials=
 of his wife and children--was removed from his post and on leave. In a ten=
se meeting held at a Houston hotel after the latest financial disclosures, =
soft-spoken Chairman and CEO Kenneth L. Lay faced 1,600 employees, with ano=
ther 5,000 hooked up via the Web. One irate worker asked if he was ""on crac=
k."" Lay, an economist by training, turned over day-to-day management in 199=
7. Until Skilling quit, citing personal reasons unrelated to Enron, Lay was=
 talking about retirement, sources say. Now he is facing his biggest fight =
ever. ""Ken is looking at a 30-year career of accomplishment going down in f=
lames. This is just awful,"" says one friend.

On the surface, at least, Enron's off-balance-sheet maneuvering hardly seem=
s the stuff that would crater a company. Amazingly, sources close to Enron =
claim that one rationale for Fastow's deals was to save an estimated $30 mi=
llion a year in investment-banking fees. Fastow's involvement in the partne=
rships, which bought assets from Enron, including stakes in telecom and ene=
rgy, was supposed to make the deals simpler for the investment bankers and =
thus cheaper. They were also meant, according to sources close to the compa=
ny, to hedge Enron's investments in potentially risky assets while allowing=
 it to maintain some control over them. Enron says Fastow made money for hi=
mself on some of the deals, but insiders insist there were less controversi=
al ways to enrich him if that were the aim. Fastow did not return calls see=
king comment. Lay, who declined to comment for this story, has said that th=
e partnerships were properly vetted by Enron's attorneys and internal and e=
xternal auditors and were approved by its board. A source familiar with Enr=
on agrees: ""We had the best lawyers in the world saying, `It looks fine.""'

But whatever Enron's reasons for creating the LJM partnerships, the problem=
s were compounded by scanty disclosure. The deals were first revealed in a =
1999 proxy, raising concerns from investors and analysts. By this summer, w=
hen Enron's stock was falling and its bets in broadband were souring, compl=
aints about LJM grew louder. So in June, Fastow pulled out of the partnersh=
ips. When the write-offs came, Enron enraged analysts and investors further=
 by failing to disclose the hit to equity in its third-quarter earnings pre=
ss release. Instead, Lay mentioned it in a conference call with analysts. ""=
We found it disconcerting that the company waited to disclose the additiona=
l $1.2 billion charge to equity in a fleeting comment in the middle of its =
conference call,"" says UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone.

BAD BETS. Still, Enron's credibility did not vanish overnight. Analysts hav=
e been lobbying for years for more information about how and where Enron ma=
kes its money in its often byzantine trading business. While the company's =
revenues were soaring from $9.2 billion in 1995 to $100.8 billion in 2000 a=
nd its stock was returning 500% during the same six-year period, Enron's ag=
gressive, even arrogant managers could ignore Wall Street's complaints with=
 impunity. But after its stock price collapsed this year (chart), the compa=
ny's attitude and operational missteps quickly caught up. And there was ple=
nty to worry about. The company's $3 billion power plant in India wasn't pa=
ying its bills amid a political controversy; its highly ballyhooed business=
 for trading high-speed communications capacity was crippled by the telecom=
 industry meltdown; and its calamitous foray into the water business with A=
zurix Corp. has already cost Enron at least $574 million in write-offs.

These bad bets and the expensive LJM shock have investors worried about wha=
t else might be lurking at Enron. Many aren't sticking around to find out. =
""I think the lack of disclosure on their financial engineering killed the c=
redibility of the management team,"" says Richard A. Giesen, who manages the=
 Munder Power Plus fund, which dumped its Enron shares about a month ago.

It's not clear just how many off-balance-sheet financing vehicles Enron has=
 used over time. Some were created years ago to finance oil and gas produce=
rs. Analysts and sources close to the deals say there's no particular risk =
in these to Enron shareholders. Other interconnected entities, such as Whit=
ewing, Osprey, Atlantic Water Trust, and Marlin Water Trust, were a way to =
get assets no longer central to Enron's strategy off its balance sheet, fre=
eing capital and credit for the core energy business and ventures like broa=
dband (table).

To entice institutional investors such as pension funds and insurers into t=
hese deals, Enron promised to kick in equity if asset sales weren't enough =
to cover debt. Such ""mandatory equity"" deals have been used by at least a h=
alf-dozen others in the energy and telecom industries, including El Paso (E=
PG), Williams, and Dominion, says Standard & Poor's director Todd A. Shipma=
n. ""Nobody's going to find anything that's particularly unique or below boa=
rd"" in such deals, says one investment banker specializing in the energy bu=
siness.

Worst case, which Shipman considers unlikely, Enron could be on the hook fo=
r about $3 billion in its mandatory-equity deals. That could mean diluting =
its shares by more than 25% at today's prices. Analyst John E. Olson at San=
ders Morris Harris Inc. (SMHG ) figures a 9% dilution is more likely. Even =
if this $3 billion in debt were included on Enron's balance sheet now, the =
debt-to-capital ratio would climb to 54% from about 49% at the end of June.=
 Such a change would pressure Enron's credit rating but not push it below i=
nvestment grade, says Shipman.

HUGE HIT. Fastow's LJM, a private equity fund, was a different kind of anim=
al, according to sources familiar with the arrangements. It bought energy a=
nd other assets from Enron, which booked gains and losses on those deals. L=
JM was also involved in complex hedging that was supposed to reduce the vol=
atility of some of Enron's investments, including stakes in high-tech and t=
elecom businesses and an interest in New Power Co., which markets power to =
consumers. When Enron terminated these deals in September, it took the $1.2=
 billion hit to equity.

But the more immediate question is whether trading partners will stick with=
 the company. The first place that might show up is in Enron's highly succe=
ssful online platform, which trades everything from gas and electricity to =
weather derivatives. To reassure its partners, Enron is scrambling to shore=
 up its liquidity. It has already tapped $3 billion in credit lines and is =
trying to arrange another $1 billion. Shipman says he has seen no signs of =
massive customer defections or drastically worsened credit terms. Still, ri=
val traders are wary. ""We certainly have taken a closer look at Enron in th=
e last week to 10 days and will continue to manage the credit risk, but we'=
re still doing business with the company as usual,"" says Keith G. Stamm, CE=
O of power and gas trader Aquila Inc. (ILA )

""SPEEDING TRAIN."" Still, with the stock battered and rating agencies consid=
ering further downgrades, that could rapidly change. In recent days, the un=
certainty about Enron's future has reduced investors' appetite for Enron de=
bt. ""No one wants to speculate on the direction or their likelihood of surv=
ival,"" says a credit-derivatives salesperson. ""It's really difficult to get=
 in front of a speeding train.""

Even if Lay can calm his trading partners, he and his management team face =
a much tougher task of restoring their credibility on Wall Street. With the=
 stock now hovering around $14--down from a high of $90 in August, 2000--so=
me even believe that Enron could be a takeover target for the likes of GE C=
apital or Royal Dutch/Shell Group. (RD ) Both declined to comment. Would En=
ron sell? One source close to the company says Enron has talked about possi=
ble mergers and strategic alliances in the past with Royal Dutch/Shell, amo=
ng others. ""If they're really worried about liquidity, they might take the =
easy way out,"" he says.

If Enron does pull through this crisis, some suspect it will be a humbler, =
more risk-averse place. The company that once believed it could expand its =
trading and logistics empire to all manner of commodities--from advertising=
 space to steel--will be forced to scale back its grandiose visions. That's=
 something some investors applaud. ""The company should focus on its strengt=
hs,"" says William N. Adams, senior energy analyst at Banc of America Capita=
l Management, a major shareholder. But that's a far less exciting place tha=
n Enron's energy cowboys ever hoped to roam.=20

Derivatives Danger?
Lately, owners of Enron's (ENE) equity, bonds, and loans have been struggli=
ng to understand how exposed the company is to risks of losses that they di=
dn't know about before. Now, as a fuller picture of Enron's entanglements w=
ith partnerships begins to emerge, investors have something else to worry a=
bout: credit default swaps, known as CDSs for short.

That's financial marketspeak for insurance on bonds and bank loans. Their o=
wners pay a premium for coverage that reimburses them for any losses they h=
ave if their investments go bad. The CDS market has existed only for about =
two years, but it's growing fast. Goldman, Sachs & Co. (GS ) and others est=
imate that bonds and loans with a face value of between $1 trillion and $1.=
5 trillion are covered. Not surprisingly, big banks with hefty balance shee=
ts such as J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM  ), Merrill Lynch (MER ), and Deutsche Ba=
nk (DB ) dominate the market.

Enron, however, is a player--and the only significant one that isn't also a=
 bank. Competitors say that although Enron has issued only between $500 mil=
lion and $700 million worth of CDSs so far this year, it had ambitious plan=
s to offer them online. ""They don't belong in this market,"" says one trader=
. ""They don't understand the implications."" Enron did not return calls seek=
ing comment.

Of course, neither Enron nor others will have to pay out unless the loans a=
nd bonds they're insuring turn bad. Trouble is, this year is potentially a =
doozie for losses on corporate debt. Corporate defaults could reach a recor=
d of $100 billion, says Standard & Poor's, like BusinessWeek a unit of The =
McGraw-Hill Companies. Regulators say shaky bank loans hit a record $193 bi=
llion by early October.

If Enron has insured any of the bad debt, it might have to take charges for=
 losses if they exceed the premiums it has been getting. With all that has =
been happening in recent weeks, that's the last thing it needs.=20

Commentary: Enron's Clout Won't Sway the SEC=20
For Securities & Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, the SEC's inv=
estigation into Enron Corp. (ENE) could hardly have come at a worse time. T=
he future of Pitt's ambitious agenda of reforms in securities regulation co=
uld depend on how well he handles this case.

Enron's political clout and close ties to President George W. Bush create r=
eal risks for the SEC. Enron CEO Kenneth L. Lay is a longtime Bush backer, =
and the company was the biggest corporate contributor to the President's ca=
mpaign. A Bush appointee, Pitt is attempting a delicate balancing act. He h=
as made it clear he wants to speed up the SEC's enforcement, in part by rew=
arding companies that cooperate with probes. But he insists the SEC will st=
ill come down hard on true corporate miscreants--and knows that any signs o=
f let-up could jeopardize the rest of his reform agenda.

Enter the Enron probe. The fine shadings of securities enforcement--where m=
ost cases are settled by negotiated penalties, not court-imposed fines--oft=
en make it hard for outsiders to tell whether the SEC is being tough or len=
ient. But Pitt must go out of his way to make it clear that the Enron case =
is handled by the book--getting the same strict scrutiny from the SEC as an=
y other, less connected company.

For now, top SEC aides say that's happening. The SEC Enforcement Div. in Wa=
shington is looking into whether Enron adequately disclosed to shareholders=
 the risks of its complex deals with Andrew S. Fastow, the company's former=
 chief financial officer. Agency insiders say Pitt and his fellow commissio=
ners will be briefed on the case as it proceeds. But they insist Pitt hasn'=
t heard from the White House or Enron's other political allies.

TOP LOBBYIST. Enron's connections are numerous. Besides Lay's links to Bush=
, an Enron director, Wendy Lee Gramm, is the wife of Texas Senator Phil Gra=
mm, top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee. And Enron spreads its l=
obbying budget--$2.13 million in 2000--across both parties. Just this year =
it hired four lobbying firms with Democratic roots. Enron says it lobbies h=
eavily because it operates in regulated industries. It notes that electric =
utilities outspend it 35 to 1.

On Oct. 31, a special committee of Enron's board hired William R. McLucas, =
former SEC enforcement director, to represent it. McLucas should know that =
any attempt to muscle the stock cops is likely to backfire. Pitt, who joine=
d the SEC out of law school in 1968, ""remembers how the [Nixon-era] SEC tai=
nted itself by turning a blind eye to [fugitive financier] Robert Vesco,"" s=
ays an agency veteran. Pitt has too much riding on the Enron probe to let i=
ts connections sway his judgment.=20

Goldman Declines Enron's Request for Loan Amid Credit Concerns
2001-11-02 11:22 (New York)

Goldman Declines Enron's Request for Loan Amid Credit Concerns

     New York, Nov. 2 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
refused to participate in a $1 billion loan to Enron Corp. because
it was unwilling to risk its capital on a client with falling
credit ratings that has been using its investment-banking services
less often, according to people familiar with matter.

     Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay asked for the line of
credit after meeting with bankers from Goldman, J.P. Morgan Chase
& Co. and Citigroup Inc. last month to discuss ways to alleviate a
cash crunch. J.P. Morgan and Citigroup agreed to lend on the
condition that the Houston-based energy trader pledge two
pipelines as collateral.

     Goldman's refusal highlights its reluctance to provide credit
lines to all but its top fee-paying clients. By not lending to
Enron, the firm also is able to advise companies that want to buy
Enron or some of its assets, or make a bid of its own.

     For Enron, the decision makes it harder to resist the demands
of its existing lenders, who made the company give up collateral
and pay higher interest rates to get its new loan.

     ``People smell resistance to Enron,'' said Glenn Reynolds, an
analyst with CreditSights.com, an independent research firm. ``The
balance of power is the with the banks now.''

     Kathleen Baum, a spokeswoman for Goldman, said the firm had
``a long history of putting its capital to work for clients.'' She
wouldn't comment on the firm's relationship with Enron. Karen
Denne, a spokeswoman for Enron, said, ``I won't confirm who we
have had talks with.''

                             Shut Out

     Enron needed the $1 billion secured loan to supplement cash
reserves and help the company pay off existing debt. Yesterday,
Standard & Poor's cut Enron's long-term credit rating to ``BBB,''
the second-lowest investment grade rating, from ``BBB+.''

     The SEC is investigating partnerships run by former Chief
Financial Officer Andrew Fastow that bought and sold Enron shares
and assets. Those trades cost Enron $35 million. The company also
lost $1.2 billion in shareholder equity.

     Enron's dealings with the partnerships have shut it out of
commercial-paper markets, where corporations borrow money for days
or weeks. Lenders are concerned that the company may have further
losses from its trading business.

     A week ago Enron tapped $3 billion in credit lines, arranged
by J.P. Morgan and Citibank, to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial
paper it has outstanding.

     Already loaded down with Enron debt, J.P. Morgan and Citibank
forced Enron to pay as much as 2.5 percentage points more than the
London interbank offered rate, or Libor, on its new loan,
according to the people familiar with the matter. That's about
five times the spread Enron is paying on its existing lines,
according to Bloomberg data.

     The extra yield wasn't sufficient incentive for Goldman to
lend. Securities firms such as Goldman are required to value
lending commitments at market prices, exposing them to potential
losses from declines in loan prices. Banks such as J.P. Morgan and
Citibank are allowed to carry the assets at full value.

                          Falling Prices

     Enron's existing loans have already fallen to between 80 and
90 cents on the dollar since the company drew them down, according
to traders.

     The company's 6.4 percent coupon notes due in 2006 fell as
much as 6 cents on the dollar today, with price indications
between 68 and 73 cents, traders said. Yesterday, traders bid for
the bonds at 74 cents and offered to sell them at 77 cents

     Goldman has been getting less investment-banking business
from Enron.

     The No. 3 U.S. securities firm by capital hasn't arranged a
bond sale for Enron since 1995, and Enron hasn't picked Goldman to
advise on an acquisition or sale since at least 1993, according to
Bloomberg data. The firm is a dealer on Enron's $3 billion
commercial paper program and has arranged six of the company's 15
preferred share sales.

     Without a steady flow of investment banking fees, Goldman is
reluctant to make loans that tie up capital in a business that is
less profitable than advising on mergers or underwriting
securities.

     Among clients the firm has turned down: Ford Motor Co., the
second-largest automaker, and Vodafone Group Plc, Europe's largest
cellular phone company.

     Goldman did extend $2 billion in credit to AT&T Corp. as part
of a $25 billion credit facility last year. The largest U.S. long-
distance phone company is one of the firm's most lucrative
clients, however, paying out more than $100 million in investment-
banking fees during the past five years.

     After refusing to lend to Enron, Goldman is unlikely to
advise the energy trader on any of its planned $2.1 billion in
asset sales, the people familiar said.

     J.P. Morgan is advising Enron on the sale of its Azurix North
American water business and may be retained, along with
Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit, to look at other disposals
and a possible sale of the whole company, the people said.

     Goldman, which has an energy trading business of its own, may
already be advising potential buyers of Enron's businesses, or
lining up a bid of its own, Reynolds said.

     ``We may well see Goldman pop up on the other side, which
would explain its reticence to lend,'' he said.


POWER POINTS: Time For A Bronx Miracle In Houston

A Dow Jones Newswires Column=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- With two outs in the bottom of the ninth and down by=
 two runs with one man on, Enron Corp. (ENE) needs nothing less than a home=
 run just to stay in the game.
This is the home run Enron must come up with: Full disclosure of the assets=
 and liabilities of those troubled partnerships that have been kept off the=
ir balance sheet, and proof the corporation can cover the difference. It's =
what stockholders, bondholders and trading partners have been demanding, bu=
t time is running out, and Enron hasn't produced.=20
""We're going to get to that number soon and tell people. We have to do that=
,"" said a source at Enron, who didn't know how quickly the disclosure would=
 come or whether it would be independently audited. ""In this environment, w=
e are going to be absolutely sure that it's accurate.""=20
Enron has about $3.3 billion in debt on the two key partnerships payable in=
 2003. The company will sell the assets in those partnerships and, in a wor=
se case scenario, will face a $1 billion shortfall that could be covered by=
 selling stock and other company assets, Enron has said. The company hopes =
that when the time comes to issue new stock, shares will be trading closer =
to $20 than their current $11.=20
Investors, however, aren't acting as if they're reassured. Part of the trou=
ble, analysts with credit-rating firm Standard & Poor's said Friday morning=
, is that until Enron sells the assets, nobody knows for sure what they're =
worth or how deep the partnerships are in the hole.=20
S&P is confident that Enron can raise enough capital to fill that hole, pro=
vided its trading partners in key energy markets continue to business with =
the company.=20
Credit Derivative Fizzle=20

To see the pickle the world's premier energy franchise is in, one needs to =
look no further than its credit derivatives trading desk. That relatively n=
ew and innovative operation was getting off the ground nicely, but the desk=
 hasn't been able to transact for three weeks, since the value of Enron's s=
tock and bonds began to plummet, according to another Enron employee.=20
Enron didn't respond to a request for comment, but the Enron Credit divisio=
n in Europe said in a release that lines are ""constrained"" as the market co=
ntinues to evaluate the company's credit position.=20
Until recently, customers would buy a credit derivative from Enron to cover=
 its exposure to bankruptcy by a third company. A big supplier to a financi=
ally troubled company like Xerox Corp. (XRX) or Lucent Technologies (LU), f=
or example, might pay Enron $1 million a year for a payout of, say, $10 mil=
lion in the event of a bankruptcy.=20
But you wouldn't pay the premium on your insurance unless you were sure tha=
t the insurance company could pay your claims. Likewise, with Enron's credi=
tworthiness in doubt, there's no reason to pay a lot of money just to excha=
nge Lucent risk for Enron risk.=20
The same holds true, though less obviously, for Enron's core business of en=
ergy trading. Some utilities, large industrial companies and other energy t=
rading companies could see their profits ruined if natural gas prices - alr=
eady on the rise at $3 per million British thermal units - shoot to $10 thi=
s winter as they did last winter.=20
To guard against that risk, companies buy contracts now for delivery this w=
inter at set prices. If a company wants to lock in winter gas at $3, should=
 it turn to Enron? If gas were to rise to $10 in January and Enron couldn't=
 deliver, Enron's counterparty paid a good price for no protection. And if =
Enron failed in a $10 gas market, that would send hundreds of companies scr=
ambling for supplies. Gas could go to $20 in a heartbeat.=20
Leading Role An Asset=20

Enron does have a man on base. The company is so important to energy market=
 participants that they desperately want Enron to survive. And any company =
that moves to lock Enron out of the market now could regret doing so if Enr=
on survives as the big dog.=20
Enron's trading partners have a pretty consistent position at this point: T=
hey are continuing to trade with Enron, but are avoiding long-term deals th=
at increase their exposure to the company. The only acceptable long-term de=
als are those that offset deals done earlier. Unless and until a bill goes =
unpaid, they'll keep delivering.=20
Enron, like the rest of the U.S. energy industry, paid its bills for Septem=
ber gas deliveries on Oct. 20 and for its September electricity deliveries =
on Oct. 25. Its next power and gas bills come due in the third week of Nove=
mber.=20
That means trading companies generally have just seven weeks of receivables=
 at risk before Enron's creditworthiness faces another test. In exchange fo=
r taking on that small risk, they keep the great market maker in business.=
=20
Lenders Show Concerns=20

Lenders, whether through holding Enron bonds or providing loans, don't have=
 the same luxury as energy trading companies that are keeping deals on a sh=
ort leash. Lenders supply cash up front and for longer periods of time, usu=
ally years.=20
Outside of long-term commitments, what worries the banks, which presumably =
got a good look at Enron's books? If Enron is now unable to make the big be=
ts with long-term energy deals that have kept it profitable for years, can =
it service all of its liabilities, known and unknown? If it has to sell pro=
fitable assets like pipelines and power plants, or otherwise put those asse=
ts at risk, will lower earnings be enough to pay rising credit costs? What =
happens if its greatest asset - its traders - leave in droves to work elsew=
here?=20
If Enron is to have a chance, it needs energy trading profits to keep rolli=
ng in so that it can continue to service its debt. So far this year, tradin=
g and other wholesale operations have accounted for $2.2 billion out of $2.=
4 billion in net recurring income before interest and taxes. By comparison,=
 Enron has made $617 million in interest payments so far this year.=20
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (C) unit Salomon Smith Bar=
ney, at least, don't show much confidence Enron can do it. When they agreed=
 to provide Enron with a $1 billion line of credit, they did so only after =
Enron posted valuable gas pipelines as collateral.=20
Bond traders - the most sophisticated investors in the world - make their m=
oney by understanding the probabilities. They're trading Enron debt at leve=
ls typically associated with distressed companies.=20
The lenders have chalked up their runs. Shareholders have ratcheted up the =
pressure.=20
Enron, now, must step up to the plate.=20

Enron Says It Remains 'Biggest' Player In EU Gas, Power

11/02/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) said in a statement Friday that it r=
emains the ""the biggest buyer and seller of gas and power in Europe,"" and t=
hat its EnronOnline platform ""continues to be the key trading platform in E=
urope.""=20
The company issued the statement in response to widespread rumors that seve=
ral companies have ceased trading gas and power with Enron since its share =
price took a nosedive last week.
In the statement, Enron added that worldwide transactions in the power and =
gas markets were averaging $3 billion to $4 billion a day, up from a 30-day=
 average of $2.5 billion at close of business Friday, Oct. 26.=20
Enron has been on the defensive after announcing a third-quarter loss of $6=
18 million two weeks ago, followed by news that it took a $1.2 billion equi=
ty write-down, based partly on transactions involving a handful of its own =
officers.=20
On Wednesday, Enron disclosed that the SEC elevated its inquiry into Enron'=
s alleged related-party transactions to a formal probe.=20
Enron Corp. secured $1 billion in new credit lines this week, but the deal =
did not appease credit-rating agency Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, which=
 lowered its rating on Enron's long-term debt by one notch to triple-B from=
 triple-B-plus and short-term debt to single-A-3 from single-A-2. Moody's I=
nvestors Service Inc. had issued debt downgrades earlier this week.=20
However, European industry sources reiterated Friday that several companies=

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron shares fall as investor concerns linger.
By Janet McGurty

11/02/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Shares in Enron Corp., the U.S. energy trading =
giant facing a federal probe into its dealings, declined on Friday amid lin=
gering investor concern about management credibility and the outcome of pen=
ding lawsuits.=20
Shares of Enron were off 62 cents, or 5.2 percent, at $11.37 in early after=
noon trade on the New York Stock Exchange, recouping some losses after plun=
ging briefly to $10.95, a closing price last seen in July 1992 and touched =
in intraday trade on Tuesday.
Enron debt due in 2006 declined about another 6 points, and was trading at =
about 65 cents on the dollar. The bonds were trading at about $1.01 two wee=
ks ago, before Enron announced on Oct. 16 a $1 billion charge, caused in pa=
rt by dealings linked to partnerships run until recently by a chief financi=
al officer who was ousted last week, and that form part of the federal prob=
e.=20
""There remain several fundamental issues that we believe need to be address=
ed before the clouds can clear above Enron's skies,"" said Ronald Barone of =
brokerage UBS Warburg.=20
Apart from the probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Barone said=
 concerns include ""the evolving state of the company's balance sheet, manag=
ement credibility and ultimate outcome of shareholder lawsuits.""=20
A handful of law firms have sued Enron, saying it overstated operating resu=
lts, failed to write down assets on a timely basis and concealed investment=
s that might require the company to issue large amounts of shares to cover =
loses.=20
Enron's woes have put it under intense investor scrutiny, with the company =
losing about $17 billion in market capitalization in the past two weeks. Th=
e AFL-CIO union umbrella urged Enron on Friday to review executive compensa=
tion and adopt procedures for insider investments, among other recommendati=
ons.=20
AFL-CIO affiliate unions sponsor benefit funds that hold an estimated 3.1 m=
illion Enron shares.=20
PREMIUM PLAYER IN RISK MANAGEMENT=20
Shares also plunged on Friday - they have fallen about two-thirds in the pa=
st two weeks - after Standard & Poor's cut Enron's credit rating late Thurs=
day, the second cut this week.=20
Although S&P said another rate cut could ensue if Enron's situation worsens=
, a team of S&P analysts told investors on a conference call on Friday they=
 were confident they were aware of all the company's financial obligations.=
=20
Enron has been criticized for providing scant details about its dealings, l=
eading to concerns about the riskiness of its obligations.=20
""Enron is a premium player in the risk management area,"" said Ronald Barone=
, a member of the S&P team who is not related to UBS's Barone.=20
The S&P analysts said they were using about $1.5 billion as the amount of o=
ff-balance sheet items, about half the $3 billion calculated in past years,=
 because of a change in reporting international energy assets, which no lon=
ger puts non-recourse debt onto the balance sheet in places like India and =
South America.=20
The S&P analysts also said they felt Enron's move to secure a $1 billion li=
ne of additional credit earlier this week sent out Enron's clear commitment=
 to credit quality.=20
They also said it seemed reasonable to expect a long-term solution to fix E=
nron's hard to understand balance sheet would assume an infusion of long-te=
rm equity as well as asset sales.=20
The S&P ratings team also said it was closely monitoring Enron's trading pa=
rtners for a change in their credit stance toward Enron and, to date, have =
seen no significant change.=20
But they cautioned that could change at any time and that was the reason fo=
r putting Enron on the credit watch listing.=20
Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay, who has been criticized=
 for not providing the public enough details on Enron, was a no-show at a b=
usiness conference in Houston where he had been scheduled to speak on Frida=
y morning.=20
Enron executive Robert Bradley, who declined to respond to questions from R=
euters after his speech, said he had been sent to replace Lay because ""Ken =
is better at putting out fires at Enron.""

Scott--My March '00 first-of-the-month numbers for AGL assumed that the total
daily firm load across all 9 pools would average 36,774 dth/day.  This would 
be
met by a combination of maximizing the daily withdrawals from IBSS as well as
the Directly assigned storage supplies with the remainder served by flowing
gas.   On days when the firm requirement falls below the 36,774 (for March 1,
our combined DSR is currently 23,758dth), I don't want to reduce IBSS
withdrawals because we need to maximize those thru March in order to have that
inventory down to the 35% level by March 31.  Otherwise, we could be liable 
for
penalties.   Instead, I would prefer to swing on the flowing gas, if necessary
and keep drawing the gas out of storage.

Please call me if you have questions or wish to discuss further.

Chris--The attached file contains updated needs requirements for March'00.
There are a couple of changes as compared to the update that I sent you
yesterday.  Please note that if you have been looking at the Total Monthly
requirements in the previous versions (in lieu of the daily dth volumes),
the
spreadsheet formula for summing the daily values to a monthly total were
only
picking up the first 29 days of March.  (This spreadsheet was originally
designed for February, which has 29 days.)   This has been corrected in the
attached version.

Sorry for any confusion.

Some bills worth noting:

SB 1460 (Kelley) - This bill would provide that an electrical
cooperative may become a member or stockholder of any other electrical
cooperative.

SB 1408 (Alarcon) This bill would enact the Environmental Justice
Technical Assistance Grant Demonstration Program.  The bill would
require the Office of Planning and Research to allocate grants in
amounts up to $25,000 to community-based nonprofit organizations in
communities with low-income populations or minority populations to
obtain technical assistance in connection with the organization's
participation in a decision to issue a permit by any board, department,
or office within the California Environmental Protection Agency, or in a
decision to issue a permit by the State Energy Resources Conservation

 Dear NewCo employees:
=20
I wanted to send a note giving you my views on the NewCo opportunity and ne=
xt steps.=20
=20
What are those opportunities?  In short, to date no competitor has taken En=
ron's dominant market position.  In most cases, competitiors are retrenchin=
g from an aggressive expansion of their deregulated business in order to pr=
otect their key regulated franchises or balance sheets. Market liquidity an=
d activity is extremely fractured and highly diminished from 2000 levels.  =
This will create opportunities as bid/offers expand and customers have less=
 choices to manage key long-term risks. This lack of transparancy and liqui=
dity will also provide numerous opportunities, in the commodity, asset and =
capital markets, to take advantage of key arbitrages across the North Ameri=
can grid.   We are faced with an energy asset overhang, in the short run, w=
hich is unprecedented since the early nineties.  This coupled with market p=
articipants selling assets to protect balance sheets will provide many oppo=
rtunities to acquire attractive energy assets at good value. However, in th=
e long-run, as we emerge from the recession and as highly energy intensive =
technology investment resumes, increasing asset values, demand for energy a=
nd energy price volatility are highly likely. On the services side, there a=
re numerous un-met needs in the market place at this point including demand=
 side management, distributed generation amongst others that only Enron peo=
ple have the complete value chain understanding to make feasible. I also be=
lieve that innovation in the energy capital markets can provide value to Ne=
wCo and our customers given the blight of liquidity in capital markets. In =
short, we are at the eve of an opportunity in the energy markets which has =
not been seen since the early nineties.
=20
What is NewCo?  NewCo will be a private company that will focus on the ener=
gy merchant business in North America which will capitalize on the opportun=
ities detailed above.  These businesses will stretch from production to mar=
ket, wholesale through retail primarily in natural gas and electricity in t=

ajority owned by Enron but will have significant outside investment to ensu=
re liquidity and legitimacy. It will be re-branded and be operating and sol=
vent by mid Q2 at the latest.  It will be seeded with a number of Enron ass=
ets and contracts that we think add value to our business or provide key cr=
edit support. Those assets are conservatively valued at approximately $500 =
million to one billion. With asset and new cash investment, NewCo should be=
 at least a billion dollar company. It will emerge as a non-debtor company =
and should be an investment grade rated company. NewCo will employ approxim=
ately 100 to 200 people depending on the mix of businesses and assets under=
 control.  These people will be sourced from the existing pool of talent in=
 Enron and ex-employees. NewCo will have access to all Enron's existing sys=
tems and infrastructure. It will be in the market of buying and selling ene=
rgy albeit not market making which will be restricted under the non-compete=
 with Netco.I would expect that we would have a strong business and transac=
tional relationship with Netco.

What will be NewCo's culture? It will have the benefits of being a small pr=
ivate company which will measure success by cashflow generation.  It will b=
e a small company atmosphere where everyone knows each other.  It will be a=
 group that celebrates success together and works hard towards shared objec=
tives.  It will have an attractive employee compensation plan particularily=
 for long term value creation.  We will build an organization of integrity =
of which people can be proud. It will center its objectives around our cust=
omers and the satisfying un-met needs in the market.  NewCo will value cust=
omer relationships.  It will be a partnership and employ an atmosphere of o=
pen communication. NewCo will be innovative, agile and nimble.
=20
What is next? There will be a meeting in 30C2 at 4:00 PM on Monday to discu=
ss issues, questions and comments.  There will also be a dinner set up for =
6:30PM on Tuesday at the Capital Grille to provide us an opportunity to spe=
nd additional social time to discuss NewCo. NewCo will be located on the 30=
th floor.  The immediate tasks in hand can be broken into the following: a)=
 opportunity and business definiton including fully vetted business plans f=
or opportunities identified around specific assets or independent of these =
assets; b) setting up infrastructure necessary to cure defaults and start p=
erforming to key operating assets including managing out of the bankruptcy;=
 c) modelling cashflows, operating costs, capital requirements and proforma=

Kate,

Thanks again for the info.  It just occurred to me that we should probably 
get this on the first or second workday of the month to get the last days of 
the previous months' prices (we have to send an end of month report to 
customers), or as soon as all of the prices are available.  Is that doable?

Caroline

Talk to Scott Josie in Houston.  Also you may want to talk to someone in RAC (Brad Larson).  Jack Schemer is a geologist who may be useful for this exercise. I don't know what group he is in.

Cheers

Kyle,

The Alberta gas desk developed a gas model which forecasts future production based upon decline rates, rig counts, etc...  This model recognizes seven different zones in Alberta and applies an average decline rate, drilling success ratio, etc to each zone.  We are trying to apply this method to the Rocky Mtns and SanJuan basin and need help from a geologist &/or reservoir engineer familiar with these basins.  Do you know of such an individual employed by Enron?"

Subject: Excelon questions - Lincoln

Don:

The questions that I was unable to answer for Excelon (PECO) during the 
Lincoln site visit are as follows:

1.  What is the gas consumption per unit during start-up?

2.  What is the reference # for the 2nd ComEd Interconnection Feasibility 
Study?  Is this document on deal bench?

3.  Do any other parties have a right to interconnect to the Project's gas 
pipeline lateral?


My input to these questions is:

1.  None.  I am not familiar with this area.

2.  I saw this 2nd study is out on deal bench at least a week ago.  As long 
as it wasn't removed, it should be there.   I do not know the reference #.

3.  I do not believe that any other parties have a right to connect to the 
gas lateral owned by Des Plaines LLC.  (In fact,  I believe that we are 
statutorily prevented from supplying gas to other end users - Des Plaines LLC 
is neither an interstate pipeline nor a gas LDC).  Please confirm my opinion 
with Stuart/Chris Meyer to make sure that we have not granted any 
interconnection rights to Northern Border/Peoples.

Call me to discuss.

Fred

Jacque Reid, anchor:
To save money, consumers are finding ways to cut down on costly electricity
bills.  Greg Clarking reports on how to get better rates using the Internet.
Greg Clarking reporting:
Helene Baldizzone, a New York City artist, was growing increasingly
concerned about rising electricity costs, so she signed up with start-up
electricity retailer SmartEnergy.com.
Helene Baldizzone (SmartEnergy.com Customer):  I thought, OK, well, let's
try somebody else because the bills had been going up little by little every
month with ConEdison.  So I thought, well, I have nothing to lose at this
point.
Clarking:  Baldizzone is happy with SmartEnergy where she has locked in a
rate of 8.3 cents per kilowatt hour.  She was paying as much as 13.3 cents
per kilowatt hour before switching.  SmartEnergy says its goal is to let
consumers take advantage of the sometimes confusing options created by
deregulation of the energy industry.
Gautam Chandra (President/CEO, SmartEnergy.com):  What we are doing is
taking that confusion away by being the agents for the customer in terms of
looking at the best prices, locking in the best prices for them.
Clarking:  SmartEnergy, currently available in New York City, will be
available in all twenty-four deregulated states within the next few months.
There are a number of electricity suppliers in each of the deregulated
states and consumers can save a lot of money by doing a little research.
Rick Cowles (Energyland.com):  Don't sit back and just hang in there and
wait and see what's going to happen a year or two down the road because
you're going to find that electric rates have definitely changed in a year
or two and it may not be to your advantage.
Clarking:  To find out what energy options are available in your area, you
can call your state's public utility commission or click on to
Energyland.com for a complete list of energy suppliers and their rates.
Cowles:  Right now, consumers are kind of in a unique position where they do
have the ability to go in and see some immediate savings.
Baldizzone:  It's easy.  But I like especially saving the money.  It's
better in my pocket.
Clarking:  That's Your Money.  Greg Clarking, CNN, New York.

Reuters
USA: Calif. utilities seek ISO power price cap cut to $100. 
? 
10/04/2000 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2000. 

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Pacific Gas and Electric Co (PG&E) said 
Wednesday it is joining with Southern California Edison and a California 
consumer group to seek a reduction of the Independent System Operator (ISO) 
price cap for electricity to $100.00 per megawatt hour (MWh) from the current 
$250.00 cap.

PG&E, the utility subsidiary of San Francisco-based PGOCorp. , proposed the 
lower price cap as part of a broader package of steps it is taking to ""make 
sure the California power market can operate more efficiently,"" a company 
official told reporters at a briefing here. 

Southern California Edison is the utility subsidiary of Edison International 
, based in Rosemead, Calif.

PGOsaid the request was backed by The Utility Reform Network (TURN), a San 
Francisco-based consumer group that has protested against soaring electricity 
prices as a result of California's bid to deregulate its electricity industry.

The California ISO, established as part of the deregulation effort, oversees 
the operation of about 75 percent of the state's power grid, serving some 27 
million people.

The move by PGOand Edison follows a summer of chaos in the California power 
market, where a shortage of electricity generated within the state and open 
market power pricing sent the cost of wholesale power to nearly twice its 
historical average, frequently trading above the proposed $100.00 cap.

Wanda --

Who do I need to call at EPMI West Power to discuss the following -

We are considering proposing a Settlement for SCE.  The language we are considering on the Negative CTC is as follows.  Does this help or hurt?  Do we have ""final ISO invoices""?  

Please call me.

A ""Doorstep"" inspection of this business was performed in accordance with our procedures and apparently this business is a disaster!!! We need immediate action on this up to and including shutting it down. This was the worst we have seen at Enron and I don't even want to put in this email what I heard was going on there. 

We need a coordinated solution here asap to avoid a real disaster, if there isn't one already. I'll speak with Rick Causey here about what immediate action we should take but the more you guys can dig into this the better. More to come.

Jeff,  Shane Lakho is currently preparing several TPA for Enron Energy Services and another EES entity.  I know that portions of EES are rolling into wholesale.  Should we be initialing for EES?  The agreements are Enron's standard TPA form so there shouldn't be any issues.

Volume Management should be fine with this change. All name changes will be 
still attached to the original path of the Buy/Sell deal. The Settlement 
Group will have to make sure that the new name that is being added to the 
deal has the appropriate 'Statement Group' attached.  Other than that this 
change should flow smoothly.

Thanks,

Subject: Re: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to

FYI....

This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the 
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.

Impact to Logistics - Unify
If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge 
backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name 
will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place.
One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production 
yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths)
This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where 
nominations were sent for entire month)
can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe 
guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing.
Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause 
an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order 
to get a clean quick response.
What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take 
place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)

I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I 
can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to 
put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when 
these type of changes are needed.

Will keep you posted.

Thanks,

dg

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)


Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with 
confirmed volumes - Tom's words of caution:

If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the 
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and 
then change the counterparty - however - I did add a warning message:

""Warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure 
pipeline allows this change.""   

Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is 
feedback - I assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems 
(pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new 
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.

Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just 
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask 
the UNIFY team.

There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM 
Market East - but not from 
ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be 
the same legal entity. 
""Warning - not the same legal entity""

Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals 
(Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out).
Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items 
were locked down for a reason.
 If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down 
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created 
using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)  

With the release that was put out Tuesday evening, Deal Validation should be 
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other 
than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).  

In addition, this release will also capture ""near-time"" the contract changes 
that are made in global.  This means that need for server bounces will not be 
necessary.

 New/Changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal 
manager.
 New Counterparties, and new/changes to facilities will require getting out 
of all active Sitara apps (except for launch pad).  
  Once out of all apps, start a new app - the respective information that you 
are looking for will appear.

I mention ""near-time"" because we are constrained by the amount of time it 
takes for the change in Global data to trigger an alert for Sitara who then 
updates its information

That Elusive Top 10

Is this the year the Longhorns finally will finish in that elusive top 10
nationally for the first time since 1983?
The Longhorns are in the top 10 right now at No. 9 in the AP poll and they
will stay in that elite group and even rise a little if they keep winning.
The biggest remaining obstacle to keeping winning is the game Saturday
against 5-1 Colorado.
The Longhorns are 10-point favorites over the Buffaloes, but Colorado, at 5-1
and with a five-game winning streak, is the most dangerous foe left on the
schedule.
Next up will be road trips to 2-3 Missouri ande 2-3 Baylor, teams which have
one Big 12 victory between them this season, followed by a game in Austin
against Kansas, also 2-3.
The Longhorns will be huge favorites in all three of those game.
Then comes the regular season finale at Texas A&M. The Aggies lost to
Colorado, 31-21, Saturday in Boulder to fall from the unbeaten ranks, but the
toughest part of their schedule remains to be played.
If  the Horns keep winning until the A&M game, they will be favored by at
least 10 points.
The Aggies have a good defense, but it isn't as good as the one at Texas, and
the Horns have a clear edge on offense.
So, barring an upset, the Longhorns should head for a bowl game at 10-1 and
with a national ranking in the top 5. A win in the bowl game would cement a
top 5 ranking, but a loss might knock the Horns just out of the top 10 in the
final poll.

Longhorn Game Notes . .

* After opening the game with a  12-play, 65-yard scoring drive, Oklahoma
State had six more possessions in the first half and gained 41 yards on 20
plays. In the second half, OSU started drives at the Texas 36 and 21 after
turnovers, but came away with zero points. After its opening TD drive,
Oklahoma State gained only  97 yards and had 163 for the game, its lowest
total of the season.
* QB Chris Simms was involved in all six  Texas touchdowns with a 1-yard
rushing TD and scoring passes of 27 yards to Brock Edwards, 5 and 16 yards to
Roy Williams and  27 and  23 yards to Sloan Thomas. He fell one short of the
UT record of seven set by Clyde Littlefield against Daniel Baker (4 pass/3
rush) in 1915. The last Longhorn to account for six touchdowns in a game was
Ricky Williams against Rice in 1998.
* Freshman LB Derrick Johnson had two tackles for losses in the first half to
move into a tie for third place on UT's all-time freshman list. He has 10
TFLs for the season, just six short of the Longhorns record held by Tony
Brackens who had 16 in 1993.
* Sophomore WR Sloan Thomas had six catches for 82 yards Saturday. Both were
career bests. His  previous highs were three catches against Missouri in 2000
and 74 yards against Texas A&M in 2000. He tied his career high with two TD
passes, last accomplishing the feat against Missouri.

UT No. 22 in Basketball Poll

The Longhorn men's basketball team has been ranked No. 22 in the ESPN.com
pre-season top 25.
Texas is one of five Big 12 Conference teams selected in the Top 25, joining
Kansas (5), Missouri (8), Oklahoma State (16) and Oklahoma (19).
The Longhorns return 57 percent of their scoring, 69 percent of their
rebounding and 63 percent of their minutes played totals from last year's
25-9 team which finished with a No. 18 national ranking in the AP poll.
Texas starts its exhibition schedule with the annual intrasquad scrimmage at
7 p.m. on Wednesday, October 31 at the Erwin Center.  Admission is free.

I would appreciate a copy of the drift number submitted for Budget 2001 and a 
copy of the analysis for Enron Europe. 

 I would also like a copy of the expected new deals for 2001 reflecting the 
average increase/or decrease in the PV of the Gross Book Balance.  I need 
this infomation in Dollar terms not percentages. I need to have the new deals 
separately for GBP, NOK, and EUR.  We are reviewing Drift and our 
anticipated  Interest rate position vs. expected 2001 economic climate.  

Thanks. Sheila

Welcome to our little corner of the world!   You'll love living here; we're
quite an eclectic bunch, and pert-near everyone is quite friendly.  The area
has much to offer, too, in the way of restaurants, shopping, entertainment,

Hey Guys!

Here is the tentative schedule for the rest of the month.  Let me know if there are any problems with it.  I didn't put anything for the last day of the month or the first day of January as we don't know what will be going on those two days at this point.

Thanks!

Below is an update on the status of the grandfather legislation. Changes from 
previous versions include a 30% reduction for oil and gas facilities instead 
of 20% and an extension of the voluntary program until 9/2002 instead of 
9/2001. I asked Skip Dees if that meant TNRCC would allow companies to 
""authorize"" grandfathered sources under old exemptions for a year longer and 
his response is below. His suggestion is to act now (as is mine). 


Skip's e-mail response: ""If the Sunset Bill passes with the current 
grandfathered facility language (and there is no guarantee of that - it ain't 
gonna get any better, and it could get worse), we'd have till 9/1/02 to apply 
for a VERP-type permit with
10-year old BACT.  The deal on applying historical PBR's to grandfathered
facilities is a TNRCC letter interpretation, and that COULD change at any
time.  If that option works for you, I'd jump on it NOW.""

		 Subject: Grandfathered Facilities - Endangered Species With No Prospects o f 
Protection


The days of grandfathered facilities in Texas are numbered.  This does not
only mean those large facilities in nonattainment areas, but ANY facility
that was constructed prior to September, 1971 and has not subsequently been
rolled into some sort of new source review (NSR) permit or Permit by Rule
(formerly Standard Exemption).  Note that proposed new rules recently
published in the Texas Register for public comment will require operators to
be able to produce documentation of applicability and compliance for all
facilities authorized by a Permit by Rule/Standard Exemption, much the same
as is required for any other type of permit.

The TNRCC Sunset Bill contains language limiting the time that such
facilities may operate without NSR authorization of some sort.  The Senate
Committee Substitute (SCS) for HB 2912 is a little stricter than the version
passed by the House, but both versions did contain grandfathered facility
permitting provisions and it is safe to assume that the final version will
also.  If this version passes, you will have one additional year to apply
for a Voluntary Emissions Reduction Permit (VERP).  If your facility is a
pipeline facility, the TNRCC will require no more than a 30% reduction in
NOx, and that reduction can be averaged for several facilities in the same
area covered in one permit.

Note that it is only through the efforts of our lobbyists - particularly
Cindy Morphew of TxOGA and Celina Romero of ATINGP - that it looks as though
we will get an additional opportunity to get these facilities permitted
without having to use today's BACT.

This memo summarizes the SCS provisions for your information.  This is NOT
actual bill language - I've TRIED to make it easier to read.

Note that these provisions may be changed somewhat if the House does not
concur in all of the changes made by the Senate and the bill goes to
Conference.  In addition, we expect a strong attempt to amend the bill on
the Senate floor to require shutdown on September 1, 2001 of grandfathered
facilities that do not have a pending permit application.  If that attempt
is successful, the opportunity to apply for a VERP will be gone on September
1.

The memo also recaps previous recommendations to you regarding the current
opportunity to claim historical Permits by Rule (Standard Exemptions) as a
means of permitting a grandfathered facility.  I am not certain how long
this opportunity will continue to exist.  TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WHILE YOU
CAN.

In addition, I've appended some information on 10-year old BACT for
gas-fired IC engines and turbines that might be useful if you are trying to
get a VERP now.




PROVISIONS OF SCS FOR HB 2912 (PRIOR TO SENATE FLOOR DEBATE)

Sec. 382.05181.  PERMIT REQUIRED.

(a)  Any grandfathered facility that does not have an application pending
for a new source review permit or other authorization, other than a federal
operating permit, and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown as
provided in Section 382.05182 may not emit air contaminants on or after:

 (1)  September 1, 2003, if the facility is located in a
nonattainment area; or

 (2)  September 1, 2005, if the facility is located in an attainment
area.

(b)  Any grandfathered facility that does not have a permit or other
authorization under this chapter, other than a federal operating permit
permit, may not emit air contaminants on or after:

 (1)  September 1, 2005, if the facility is located in a
nonattainment area; or

 (2)  September 1, 2007, if the facility is located in an attainment
area.

(c)  Facilities eligible for a Small Business Stationary Source Permit are
subject to the permitting deadlines in Section 382.05184.

Sec. 382.05182.  NOTICE OF SHUTDOWN.

(a)  A notice of shutdown to allow operation of a grandfathered facility
beyond the deadlines of 382.05181(a) must be filed with the commission
before the applicable deadline.

(b)  A notice under this section shall include:

  (1)  the date the facility intends to cease operating;

  (2)  an inventory of the type and amount of emissions that
will be eliminated when the facility ceases to operate; and

  (3)  any other necessary and relevant information the
commission by rule deems appropriate.

GENERAL PROVISIONS (APPLICABLE TO PERMITS UNDER 382.05183, 382.05184, AND
382.05186)

(a)  The commission shall grant a permit under this section if, from the
information available to the commission, including information presented at
any public hearing or through written comment, the commission finds that
there is no indication that the emissions from the facility will contravene
the intent of this chapter, including protection of the public's health and
physical property.

(b)  If the commission finds that the emissions from the facility will not
comply with Subsection (c), the commission may not grant the permit under
this section.

(c)  A person planning the modification of a facility previously permitted
under this section must comply with new source permitting requirements
before modifying.

(d)  The commission may adopt rules as necessary to implement and administer
this section.

(e)  If an applicant omits any relevant facts or submits incorrect
information in an application, the applicant shall submit the relevant facts
or correct the information no later than 60 days after discovering the
error.  If while processing the application, the commission determines that
additional information is necessary to evaluate or to take final action on
the application, the commission may request the information and set a
reasonable deadline for a response.  Failure to comply with the deadline for
the response will result in the application being returned to the applicant.

Sec. 382.05183.  EXISTING FACILITY PERMIT.

(a)  The owner or operator of a grandfathered facility may apply for a
permit to operate the facility under this section.

(b)  The commission shall grant a permit under this section if, from the
information available to the commission, including information presented at
any public hearing or through written comment, the commission finds that the
application:

  (1)  is filed before September 1, 2002 and the facility will
use an air pollution control method at least as effective as 10-year old
BACT; or

  (2)  is filed before the applicable deadline of 382.05181(a)
and the facility will use current BACT.

(c)  The commission may issue an existing facility flexible permit for some
or all of the grandfathered facilities at a site.  Permits issued under this
subsection shall follow the same permit issuance, modification, and renewal
procedures as existing facility permits.

Sec. 382.05184.  SMALL BUSINESS STATIONARY SOURCE PERMIT.

(a)  Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business
stationary source and are not required by commission rule to submit an
annual emissions inventory report may apply for a permit under this section
before September 1, 2005.

(b)  Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business
stationary source that does not have an application pending for a new source
review permit or other authorization, other than a federal operating permit,
and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown, may not emit air
contaminants on or after September 1, 2007.

Sec.  382.05185.  ELECTRIC GENERATING FACILITY PERMIT.

Special provisions for permitting grandfathered electric generating
facilities are not outlined in this memo.

Sec. 382.05186.  AUTHORIZATION FOR PIPELINE FACILITIES.

(a)  The commission by rule shall establish the procedures for applications
for grandfathered processing, treating, compression, or pumping facilities
connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline.

(b)  Based on a prioritization by the commission as necessary to meet local,
regional, and statewide air quality needs related directly or indirectly to
federal air quality standards, the commission may require up to a 30%
reduction of the hourly emission rates of NOx and VOC from reciprocating
internal combustion engines subject to this section.  For facilities other
than reciprocating internal combustion engines that are connected to or part
of a gathering or transmission pipeline , the commission may consider
requiring hourly emissions rate reductions of up to 30% for NOx and 20% for
VOC.  The commission by rule may designate counties or regions of the state
where greater reductions in the hourly emission rate will be required than
in other areas, but no more than 30 percent reductions in the hourly rate
may be required in any area.

(c)  The commission shall:

  (1)  allow for a single permit for all facilities connected
to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline;

  (2)  allow for required reductions for facilities under this
section to be achieved at one facility or averaged among more than one
facility and located in the same local, regional, or statewide areas
designated by the commission under Subsection (b);

  (3)  for purposes of emission averaging, allow emission
reductions achieved from grandfathered since September 1, 1997; and

  (4)  allow an owner or operator to apply for separate
permits under this section for discrete and separate facilities connected to
or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline.

(d)  Facilities authorized by this section shall be considered permitted
under this chapter.




CURRENT OPPORTUNITY TO CLAIM A PERMIT BY RULE TO ""PERMIT"" A GRANDFATHERED
FACILITY

TNRCC has interpreted its rules to allow operators to permit grandfathered
facilities using any applicable ""Permit by Rule,"" including those previously
referred to as Standard Exemptions.

For instance, old Standard Exemption 7, effective May 8, 1972, was for ""Gas
fired internal combustion engines of less than 2000 hp and engine trains of
less than 5000 hp total"" and can be used to permit any such engine(s).  For
clarification on this particular exemption, the language used by staff in
proposing this exemption to the Texas Air Control Board in 1972 was as
follows:  ""Engines smaller than 2000 hp are quite numerous and are not
considered a substantial source unless joined together IN SERIES (emphasis
added) to form an engine train.  Engine trains of less than 5000 hp are not
considered a substantial source.  Because control technology for NOx
emissions from internal combustion and gas fired engines is very limited, it
is doubtful if significant control could be achieved through the permit
system at this time.""  (""Exemptions From Permits Procedures and
Justification for Exemptions,"" <signed> Charles R. Barden, P.E., Executive
Secretary, Texas Air Control Board, May 8, 1972.)

A list of the ""Historical Standard Exemptions"" is available on the TNRCC
Website at http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/air/nsr_permits/oldselist/index.html
<http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/air/nsr_permits/oldselist/index.html> .  In
applying these ""Permits by Rule,"" be sure to check the corresponding
""Exemption Preambles"" (if any) for any applicable General Conditions.

TNRCC has asked that we document such permitting of grandfathered facilities
by PI-8 AND a simple notification cover letter to them so that they will
have a record that the facilities have been permitted and are no longer
considered to be grandfathered.  The registration will buy you a letter of
acknowledgement that you have claimed the ""permit by rule"" (don't use the
term ""exemption"" in any correspondence) for these engines.

Subject: Response to 11/21/00 Teleconference 001204

I believe that we have now gotten the last bit of information that the TRNCC
will provide to us regarding the development of guidelines for 10-year BACT
for grandfathered engines and turbines for use in the VERP program.  The
last piece of information is an email that I am forwarding to you with this
email.  It is an email from John Steib to which he attaches an email from
Jim Linville.  In response to a request from us, Jim Linville sets forth in
his email an example of a large engine with emissions in the 29 gram per
horsepower hour range that cannot reduce emissions to the 2-8 gram level and
what the owner/operator of that engine must demonstrate in order to obtain a
VERP permit.
Remember, that in order to be included in the TNRCC's January 15, 2001
report to the legislature, a letter of intent or application for a VERP
should be filed with the TNRCC on or before next Thursday, December 7, 2000.
To summarize, we have obtained the following policies from the TNRCC:
1. Grandfathered internal combustion engines of less than 2000
horsepower can be authorized by Standard Exemption No. 6 effective December
1, 1972, regardless of the level of emissions from those facilities. (See my
letter to Kerry Drake dated September 15, 2000 and Drake's letter to me
dated October 3, 2000).
2. Grandfathered engine trains of less than 5000 horsepower, or a
portion of an engine train up to 5000 horsepower may be authorized under
Standard Exemption No. 6, December 1, 1972, so long as each engine in the
train does not exceed 2000 horsepower.  (See my letter to James Randall
dated November 1, 2000 and Randall's letter to me dated November 16, 2000).
3. Grandfathered turbines of less than 20,000 horsepower may be
authorized by Standard Exemption No. 82, dated December 1, 1972 regardless
of the level of emissions.  (See my letter to Kerry Drake dated September
15, 2000 and Drake's letter to me dated October 3, 2000).
4. Grandfathered engines and turbines that are able to be controlled to
the 2-8 gram range will not be subject to an economic reasonableness review.
(See James Randall's letter to me dated November 16, 2000).
5. Grandfathered engines and turbines that are not able to be
controlled to the 2-8 gram range may be permittable under a VERP if there is
test data to validate the old (pre-modification) and new (post-modification)
emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions
would be achieved.  Also needed would be a representation of the cost of the
controls and even though additional modifications are available, the
additional cost is prohibitive. (See Jim Randall's letter to me dated
November 16, 2000 and the email attached hereto).

I hope all of this is helpful.  I have forwarded to you copies of the
referenced letters by fax on earlier dates.  If you need another copy please
let me know.

Celina and James,

During our teleconference today, you asked for an example of what we would
consider ""significant emission reductions"" that would be acceptable in a
case-by-case review when the 2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx level could not be achieved.
A large 2-stroke engine that is currently emitting approximately 29 g/hp-hr
of NOx would be considered to have significant emissions reductions if
actual emissions are reduced by 50 percent even though it does not meet the
2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx level.  We would agree that this would have been
considered BACT 10 years ago if there was test data to validate the old
(pre-modification) and new (post-modification) emission rates to document
that verifiable reductions in actual emissions would be achieved.  Also
needed in the case-by-case review would be a representation of what the cost
of the controls would be with a discussion of why the  2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx
level could not be achieved.  This may be due to technical limitations such
as no additional controls or modifications are possible, or you may identify
cost in dollars per ton of NOx controlled to show that even though
additional modifications are available, the cost is prohibitive.

Re: Permitting Grandfathered Internal Combustion
  Engines and Turbines

Dear Ms. Romero:

As discussed in our meetings and teleconferences concerning the options for
grandfathered internal combustion engines and turbines, we have agreed that
some of these facilities may qualify under Standard Exemption Nos. 6 or 82,
effective on December 1, 1972 and others may be permitted under 30 Texas
Administrative Code (TAC) Chapter 116, Subchapter H:  Voluntary Emission
Reduction Permits (VERP).  Specific questions raised are discussed below.

You have asked for our understanding of what qualifies as an ""engine train
of less than 5,000 hp."" In your November 1, 2000 letter you gave two
examples of ""engine trains"" that you felt would meet Standard Exemption No.
6, ""Gas fired internal combustion engines of less than 2000 hp and engine
trains of less than 5,000 hp total.""  We agree that several engines, each
less than 2000 hp, can be combined into a ""train"" providing compression to a
common header so long as the train does not exceed 5,000 hp, meet the
exemption requirements.  In cases where the total horsepower in a train
exceeds 5,000 hp, we will allow exemption of individual engines within such
a train provided that each engine is less than 2000 hp and the total
horsepower of exempted engines in the train does not exceed 5,000 hp.  In
the same standard exemption list, turbines were covered by Standard
Exemption No. 82, ""Gas turbines of less than 20,000 hp burning sweet natural
gas.""

The other major point of discussion has been the determination of ""10 year
old BACT"" required by 30 TAC o116.811(3)(A).  As we discussed, our review of
permitting 10 years ago reveals that very few, if any, old engines were
permitted; so no data is available to show what we would have required for
nitrogen oxides (NOX) best available control technology (BACT).  New engines
were permitted at 2 grams/horsepower-hour (g/hp-hr) of NOX for both rich
burn and lean burn engines.  At that time older rich burn engines could have
been readily upgraded with catalytic converters to meet this 2 g/hp-hr limit
for NOX.  Lean burn engines were and are still more problematic as both
2-stroke and 4-stroke versions are available, and no single method of
control is applicable.  The large number of different engine manufacturers,
and the availability of various models, makes it impossible to establish a
single 10 year old BACT level.  Some of the older engines may be capable of
being upgraded to meet a level of NOX of 5 to 8 g/hp-hr, the level
established in the 1992 revision of Standard Exemption No. 6, which also
established a 3 g/hp-hr standard for turbines.  While the standard exemption
does not establish BACT for upgrades it does recognize what is available.
Many of the grandfathered engines are large and some have emissions as high
as 25 to 29 g/hp-hr, so significant emission reductions may be achievable
even if they are not able to reduce to the emissions control level of 2 to 8
g/hp-hr.  The 10 year old BACT review on these engines and turbines will
have to be done on a case-by-case basis just as we would have done 10 years
ago.

We hope this guidance will allow your members to decide which engines they
will be able to either exempt or permit under the VERP program and submit
their letters of intent to participate in the VERP program by December 7,
2000.

For engines and turbines that your members decide to propose for
authorization under Standard Exemption Nos. 6 and 82, please identify the
specific engines and turbines, identified by unit number, emission point
number (EPN), air quality account number, and plant name; and for each
account please submit a Form PI-7.  For each engine or turbine, please
submit a, Table 29 or 31 as applicable, and other technical information that
will support the standard exemption claim.

For engines that will be authorized by a VERP permit, please identify each
engine by unit number, EPN, air quality account number, and plant name, and
provide an estimate of the amount of emissions reductions anticipated as a
result of participation in the VERP program.  When the VERP applications are
submitted, information should be provided to show that NOX emissions will be
in the 2 to 8 g/hp-hr range.  If it is not possible to achieve this level of
emissions, please submit information that shows that it is not technically
feasible or economically reasonable to control NOX emissions to that level.
Information showing that actual emissions reductions will be achieved, even
when the targeted range of 2 to 8 g/hp-hr cannot be met, will be helpful in
staff review of the application.

We appreciate your assistance in helping us to make the VERP program a
success.  If you have any further questions, please contact Mr. James

We would like to make progress as soon as possible on setting up these legall 
entities, as other tax-driven restructurings are about to be unleashed and 
getting the operational side of the transfer into a new entity will take the 
longest to execute.
shows the step we wish to take.
I have deliberately not placed ECCL anywhere because it is probably moving 
around.
On what basis should we decide whether to create ECHI and ECCI as LLCs or 
Corporations?

Many thanks,

Sharon are coming in on the 22nd and leaving Christmas morn. Got an e-mail

figured out when since he took off for Thanksgiving. He may just come in for
Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Himm and Paul were here for four days they
went hunting with James to the deer lease after Thanksgiving. They didn't
get anything though.
        Today is Janice's 40th BIRTHDAY.......Barry is planning a surprize
Birthday Party tonight. I'm keeping the kids while Patty picks Janice up and
they have a date to do their Nails. Patty is taking her for her Birthday
present.......Then Barry is picking up the kids and we are all suppose to
meet down by the mailboxes on their block and surprize her.......So don't
spill the beans HA! HA! That makes me feel old.......Boy, Well all for now.

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other."

Kevin,

I'm attaching the template of the 2 week cash flow forecast.  I broke it down into peak and off-peak sections for next week and the following week - by counterparty, by region, and by sell/buy.  I have two separate sheets in the file according to the way it is sorted - one is by counterparty and the other is by region.  Keep in mind that the ancillaries have a fixed price of zero because the load deals were done based upon a bundled 24-hour energy price which included the cost of the ancillaries.  The column titled ""Fill Price"" is for you to fill in.  Also, I've explained the template to Don Miller so all you will need to do is forward it on to him once you enter your prices and he will understand it all.

I'll call you in the morning to make sure all is well!

-Casey

Daren,

I have some flow at the above referenced meter without a deal.  Flow was for 
the first 2 days only, and probably occured as the meter was in the process 
of being shut in.  We purchased the gas from Torch-Rally Partnership in 
Sept.  Can you extend the deal, or should I allocated off to strangers?

Please advise.

Attached is a draft of  2001 Objectives.  I have not yet had the opportunity 
to sit down with Dave Neubauer and his direct reports and probably won't 
until after the holidays.  I will update the objectives at that time.

 I have not included some of the standard objectives (e.g. ""prepare current 
estimate"") but have tried to keep the statements  at a higher level.

Let me know if you have any questions or wish to discuss.

Your e-mail is the first I had seen of the override letter.  Attached is
the blackline you requested showing changes from the original West
LB/ABB Agreement to the final form agreement.  Can we set up a time
early tomorrow to discuss this (or late tonight)?  I have a conference
call in 2 minutes  that will probably last a couple of hours.  Please
leave a voice mail letting me know when you want to discuss the ABB
override letter.

Subject: Workload Responsibiities in Argentina

Andrea and Fabian;

Over the past few days, Randy Young, Mike Guerriero and I discussed the 
proper manner to have the both of you working as an integrated legal team in 
Argentina.  According to Mike, the below listed activities are being pursued 
in Argentina:

Wholesale Origination
Retail Origination
EES
EnronOnline
Power Trading
Gas Trading
Weather Derivatives
Energy Finance
Networks

Although I would be comfortable to leave the workload division up to you, I 
would like to suggest the following (bearing in mind that there is never a 
clear understanding about ""where you draw the line""):

Andrea:  Wholesale and Retail Origination; EnronOnLine; Power and Gas 
Trading; Weather Derivatives; Energy Finance.
Fabian: Wholesale and Retail Origination; EES; Energy Finance.

Please correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to me that there is not a 
significant difference between Wholesale and Retail Origination deals in 
Argentina.  In view of this, I would suggest the two of you assist all 
Origination deals (regardless of being a Wholesale or a Retail deal).  Also, 
both of you should be involved in Energy Finance as I believe such deals 
would arise from Wholesale and Retail Origination transactions.  In short, 
both of you would do legal support to ""Origination"", however, Andrea would 
focus on Trading and Fabian would concentrate in EES type of deals.

In addition, Fabian would manage Luiz Watanabe's workload in Argentina, but I 
would leave this to Luiz to structure and implement.

Kindly let me know if my thoughts make sense to you and please return to me 
with your comments asap.

I have not made any reference to ""Networks"" as I have no idea what it relates 
to ...  Is this related to Enron Communication ?

As a final note, please be advised that our baby should arrive on Thursday, 
July 23.  As of such date, I will be available by e-mail and cel phone only.

Rgds,

Sami

With the formation of the Management Committee we are discontinuing the Enron Executive Committee.  Instead of weekly Executive Committee meetings with a subset of Enron's Managing Directors, we will hold quarterly meetings which will include all of Enron's Managing Directors.  These meetings will allow a wider dissemination of information and views and will enable more substantive discussions about the opportunities and challenges we face.

The members of the Management Committee will continue to meet each Monday at 11:00 a.m. (Houston time)."

Hey Guys.

The ISO cutting our off-peak imports from PV has been an ongoing problem. Now that we are doing congestion wheels again we can finally do something to avoid these cuts using congestion wheels. 

Normally the ISO will cut our Import and shift our load from NP15 (PGE1&2&3) across the path to relieve the congestion. If you submit a congestion wheel there cannot be $30 cong,  thus they will not cut your schedule going in at PV.  Instead of shifting your load the ISO will award your congestion wheel and everybody will be happy. It is important to make your wheel larger then your import to ensure that part of your import not getting cut. I would recommend to put in the max number of MW's you think you can buy in the North and get rid of in the Desert. Go big in the off-peak, we submitted 200MW wheels Saturday and I think its safe to do similar size most nights.

Bruce/Dan , my only comment on th AOS contract is that Enron needs a ROFR on 
any volumes post 9:00 AM.  If Enron does not want the gas then, Keyspan  / BP 
has the right to market the gas to any other counter party.


Cheers,

Grant

2) I still have not seen a transaction confirmation regarding our St.Claire

3) Have you had a chance to look at numbers regarding our

CEMC/Enron Alliance AOS agreement




Dan, after talking to Mike Kleiner from Gulf and Grant Oh we determined the
wording in the contract handcuffs Crestar to move volumes after 9:00am MST
if additional volumes become available that Crestar did not have prior to
9:00am MST. Mike came up with the wording below to give Crestar the option
to move gas after 9:00am.

Please review and if you are in agreement please make the change to the
subject agreement.

Thanks,

RE: Transaction No. 1a; March 22, 2001

We are writing to obtain your waiver of certain requirements under the
subject agreement.

The specific circumstance of concern arises where, prior to 9:00 am on a
Nomination Day, CEMC advises Enron that it will not deliver gas or will
deliver less than the maximum DCQ, because CEMC does not expect to have
sufficient volumes available on the next Gas Day to enable it to utilize
all
of Customer's AOS.  Should circumstances change after 9:00 am on a
Nomination Day such that CEMC expects to have additional volumes available
on the next Gas Day, CEMC wishes to be authorized to utilize Customer's AOS
to deliver those additional volumes.

If you agree to allow CEMC to deliver volumes in the circumstance outlined
above, we request that you confirm your agreement on the duplicate copy of
this letter provided for that purpose.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Robert Briden"

I was informed late last week that EOL is looking to me to determine whether 
U.S. counterparties should be permitted to trade European power products via 
EOL.  According to Edmund Cooper and Tana Jones, the London office is 
deciding whether European counterparties should be permitted to trade U.S. 
power products via EOL.  I believe that this allocation of counterparty 
review responsibility (with regard to power products) should be reversed.  
The legal team for U.S. power is in the best position to determine whether a 
counterparty, domestic or European, has the requisite legal authority to 
trade U.S. power, and I believe that the London office is better positioned 
to determine whether a counterparty, U.S. or other, has the requisite 
authority to trade a European power product.

As we have discussed during the last week, a counterparty must have specific 
federal regulatory authorization in order to trade U.S. power.  I cannot 
identify any foreign counterparties from my lists of federally authorized 
entities and think it highly unlikely that a foreign counterparty will have 
the necessary authority to trade U.S. power.  Jim Fallon has expressly 
instructed me that in the event we do not currently trade U.S. power with a 
counterparty and cannot otherwise confirm that a specific counterparty 
possesses regulatory approval to trade power, a counterparty should NOT be 
permitted to trade U.S. power via EOL.  Accordingly, I return to my initial 
position that except for those foreign counterparties with whom we are 
currently trading over-the-counter (if any), all foreign counterparties 
should be granted read-only access to U.S. power products.  In the event a 
specific counterparty requests access to U.S. power trading, we can examine 
whether that specific party possesses the necessary authority to trade 
power.  

Edmund Cooper and Justin Boyd are reviewing whether a similar bar should 
apply to the trading of European power by U.S. counterparties, and I will 
defer to their judgment on that issue.

Please call me at *36121 with any questions or comments.

Regards,

Leslie Hansen"

Lee,

Here's a revised draft incorporating your two suggestions:



I've forwarded what I have on the CO (#3) for South America to their lawyer, 
so I hope it will be wrapped up soon.

I've seen reference to the Pleasanton CO, and I know it is in the works as 
well.  It is percolating through the system.  

Do you have the electronic file for the LV CoGen change order (#4), extending 
the delivery dates?

I'll be in on Monday, although I have a heavy conference call schedule.  I'll 
be easiest to catch towards the end of the day.

Subject: Proposal to Caithness Big Sandy

Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to 
Caithness for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Sandy project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Caithness' 
consultant, George Briden, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, James 
Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you 
have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.

Attached is the file containing details for the Financial Liquidations 
relating to Physical Index trades.  Thanks to Troy and Jim, we have 
eliminated the duplication of the intra-month transport liquidations in the 
daily P/L.  The Liquidations for transport that are included below are 
positions that must be rolled out of my intra-month book and into the FT-West 
P/L.  The offsetting liquidations should be coming through Chris Walker's 
Financial Liquidations Process.   We are still unable to provide support out 
of ERMS for the liquidations relating to transport.  I have included the 
values for all of the intra-month December Liquidations below.

Index 
Positions

Intra-month Transport Options Spreads                            $(228,657) 
Transport Model - No Support - Offsetting value in FT-West
Intra-month Transport Demand Reimbursement                $73,582 Transport

Hi Derek,

Are you still interested in beers today?  I have unfortunately come down
with a nasty flu, I am going to have to bail out.  I feel like a scumbag
since I initiated the get together, but I'm sure you don't want to be
infected.  Would you like to reschedule for the week of November 20th?

Mr. Kean,

As we discussed on the telephone this morning, I would like to forward my
resume to you because I believe that you will be interested in reviewing my
resume.

I believe that I have the qualities that will benefit Enron. I have strong
quantitative skills, and my experience as a project engineer gives me
experience dealing with people and getting things done on time and under
budget.

I am excited about Enron because I believe that working in a growing and
developing company can help me to grow and develop.

Thank you for forwarding this and I hope to hear from you soon.

Mike Wright

Subject: SCE's Rate Stabilization Legislative Proposal

I reviewed the proposed legislation written by SCE introducing changes to the 
PU Code for Rate Stabilization at the end of the AB 1890 Rate Freeze.  The 
following are my observations:

SCE realizes that maintaining the AB1890 Rate Freeze will most likely not 
help them recover their remaining CTCs and may in fact result in reducing the 
level of CTC revenues recovered thus far.  Under the AB1890 Rate Freeze, 
SCE's shareholders now incur the risks associated with the commodity market 
prices.
SCE also realizes that the CPUC, State of California, and public will not 
allow SCE to artificially end the rate freeze early and forego recovery of 
CTCs as revealed in the bill language: ""which could cause such electrical 
corporations to elect to take a loss on collection of utility 
generation-related assets and obligations in order to terminate the rate 
freeze that is currently providing protection from the current high and 
volatile electricity prices.""
Realizing that no one will allow customers to see high and volatile 
electricity prices, SCE has proposed and supports this Rate Stabilization 
Proposal, so that it  can exercise the option to artificially end the rate 
freeze early.
This type of option to PG&E and SCE could result in a financial loss to Enron 
Energy Services if the Rate Stabilization proposal does not equal apply to DA 
customers, as well as SO customers.
It is clear that the proposal is to require the CPUC to stablize rates after 
the AB1890 Rate Freeze.  It is not clear whether the proposal is a rate 
freeze or cap, that is left up to the CPUC.  Most of the implementation 
details are left to the CPUC, provided that the CPUC implemented a 
non-bypassable rate to customers who benefit and the stabilized rates remain 
in effect through March 31, 2003.
It  is not clear whether the Post Freeze Rate Stabilization proposal applies 
equally to DA customers, even though the bill states: ""Customers who have 
chosen to purchase electricity through direct transactins may also be 
experiencing large increases in electricity costs.""
It is clear the SCE wants to move to a new paradigm from the AB1890 Rate 
Freeze where SCE's shareholders incur the risks of high and volatile comodity 
prices to this Rate Stabilization Proposal (Rate Freeze or Cap) where 
ratepayers incur such risks.  (This clearly demonstrates why utilities are 
the wrong company for the job).
Despite our philosophical beliefs or future value propositions, if the Rate 
Stabilization Proposal allows utilities to end the rate freeze early and does 
not equally apply to DA customers, depending on when utilities will elect to 
end the AB1890 Rate Freeze, we may be talking about a $100 million hit or 
swing to our book.
Needless to say, we need to support parity between DA and SO under the Rate 
Stabilization Proposal.

Stan felt it would be appropriate for the Policy Committee to review the attached changes to the Analyst / Associate PRC process, prior to execution.  In summary, the following modifications have been developed by the heads of the AAPRC Committees (Horton, Kean, and Sherriff) and A/A Program Management (Lemmons):

?	Most cross-calibration will be at the business unit level, since this is where the best interaction and information gathering occurs.  Steps to ensure consistency across the business units are outlined in the memo.  The final PRC meeting will focus on business unit ranking distributions, and the names/attributes of the top performers across the company.
?	The PRC committees have been expanded to improve the quality of representation, and to reflect the diversity of our workforce.  The additions were selected from a pool of high performing VPs and Directors.  To ensure fairness, only VPs and Directors will provide representation on the AAPRC Committee.  
?	An attachment has been included to clarify program tenure and promotion criteria.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss by mid-day Wednesday, May 9.  We are planning to release this information to the memo distribution list that evening.

Regards,
Billy

Nancy,

As difficult as this is to believe, we have been told that VEPCO wants
Enron to take the first crack at the interconnection agreement.  Please put
this on your list.  I will check around here to see if there is a form we
want to use as a starting point.

Hi Carol,

I spoke to Ginette Berthel at Maclaren Energy, regarding your e-mail.

Regarding point #2 below, Maclaren would like its cross default threshold
amount to be US $50 million.  They are fine with the Enron threshold being
at US $100 million.

Regarding the CSA, since Great Lakes Power is giving a $12 million parental
guarantee, the collateral threshold amount for Maclaren should be $12
million.  Your e-mail below states that Enron' parent will be giving a $30
million parental guarantee.  My understanding is that this guarantee was to
be $15 million.  Regardless, I believe that Maclaren is only willing to
accept $15 million of credit risk from both Enron entities.  Therefore, the
threshold amount should be $15 million.

Please e-mail or call me to discuss.

Regards,
Michael Akkawi
416-865-8122

Michael:
I spoke with Ed Sacks, our credit person, and here is a summary of where we
stand on responding to your mark-up:

1.   Rider 1 is okay.
2.   No change will be made to the Threshold Amount.
3.   Early Termination Payments will be calculated using the Loss Method as
this is Enron's current policy.
4.   Riders 2, 3 and 4 and your changes to pages 2 and 9 of the ISDA
Schedule are okay.
No chnages to the CSA Schedule will be made.

With respect to the Guarantys, we have received the Great Lakes $12 million
Guaranty and Enron's Guaranty will be amended to increase the cap to $30
million and we will add your language.

Please confirm that all of this is okay with Maclaren.

The confirm form is one of the many current templates used by the confirm 
desk depending on the specific transaction type and the counterparty.  For 
instance, this template is not the used for a swap (e.g. not a cap, floor, 
collar or swaption) and would not be used even for a plain vanilla swap if 
the customer had not signed an ISDA Master Agreement.  The index language can 
be used in a variety of contexts but again depends on exactly which type of 
trade you are doing.  But I thought you guys had decided to use the first 
price published in the following month rather than the average of the entire 
month language attached so this may not be the final version.

Loan product type.  Commercial is planning on launching this next Wednesday.  
I'm not sure if you would consider this just another Nat Gas phy product or 
if it requires special treatment.

Let me know your thoughts.

Subject: Re: new hub product descriptions  

Item 1 - Agreed; see my Revision Marks.

Item 2 - How about listing the Contract Price as the difference between the 
Bid and Offer; see my Revision Marks.

Also, are you suggesting we change the Product Short Descriptions to what you 
have placed in bold? If so, then your Product Short description on the 
website will be redundant, and look like this:  

Chicago Phy Gas Park Chi Peoples 20Jun00-Jul00 USD/MM; 

and if you ever wanted to offer another Product based on a different Location 
it would be messy:

Chicago Phy Gas Park Mich Con 20Jun00-Jul00 USD/MM, 

so we would have to build another Product Type. I think that it's important 
to leave the Product Type generic (i.e. 'US Gas Phy Loan') which would allow 
you to transact on other locations (i.e. US Gas Phy Loan   Mich Con  20Jun00 
-Jul00 USD/MM; or US Gas Phy Loan   Demarc  20Jun00 -Jul00 USD/MM) and we can 
set those up quickly and easily.

I would really like to get these last issues finalized as quickly as 
possible. Building the Product Type is easy; chasing everyone down to get 
their part done is where I start running into time delays.

Subject: new hub product descriptions

I have changed the Product description again, but I think that this will be 
the final change.  Please review the Product example worksheet for a detailed 
examples of how I think these products will work.  

Dale,

I have modified your long product description for both the Park and the Loan 
products.  Hunter and I have reviewed your description and we have the 
following comments:

1.  We should ensure that both ""legs"" of these transactions are firm.  
Currently only the ""payback"" portion of the transaction is labeled as firm.

2.  Do we need to state the Contract price is the difference between the 
sales and purchase price.  I will make my market based on these prices, but 
there are many other factors that will effect my actual bids/offers. 

Additonally, we are still waiting for product manager set-up on our 
computers; although, we have been approved for these products by security.  
Thanks


Richard

Hi, Ken:

I'm a former ECT VP who is just down the street, back at Ryder Scott Company
which was my home before my six-years with Enron.  A great six-ears, in
fact, I learned much and enjoyed the Company and the company, but it does
feel better to be back in the ""oil patch"".  I still have stock and will
continue to be a stockholder as I know the company will continue to be
innovative and dynamic.

My reason for this email is a recent op-ed piece in the Houston Chronicle by
Robert Buzzanco decrying the current campaign against terrorism.  His
editorial was at best silly, fraught with inaccuracies (as a geological
engineer I rely on facts - minorities make up 34.4% of the combined arm
forces - not the opposite as suggested in Buzzanco's piece) and intended
only to protract his personal agenda which has nothing to do with peace.
This may be more about selling his anti-American books than current events.
I could really care less about this person, he certainly has the right to
conduct his protest, many have fought and died for his right and more may
die in the coming days.  I do object to this guy using the University of
Houston to lend credibility to his cause.  That's like an Enron employee
(purely an example) marching in protests wearing the logo and identifying
him or herself with Enron.  He is a private citizen when he writes an
editorial or marches in protest.  He used his position at UofH  to get his
piece in the paper.  I know you are an alumnus, and I ask you to read his
editorial (10/8) and respond according to your hear.

Keep the ship on course, Ken.

Respectfully

Thomas M. Talley"

 It is critical to our nation's energy future  to achieve robust competition 
in wholesale power markets in order to ensure that electricity can move most  
effectively from where it is produced to where it is most needed. To that 
end, this Administration will strongly encourage the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission( FERC)  to actively exercise jurisdiction over all 
aspects of electricity transmission in interstate commerce and place all uses 
of the grid under the same rates, terms, and conditions.  This jurisdiction 
must also be extended by Congress to cover non-FERC jurisdictional power 
authorities.

Here are my preliminary thoughts about Broadwing's likely responses to our 
claims, and how we might respond to them.  I'd like to discuss these with 
you, Dave, sometime this week, as well as your thoughts about the likely 
course of the arguments.  I'd also invite Brad and Ron to add to or modify my 
statements, below, if they are not accurate.  Dave and Steve, now that we're 
in this thing, I want to hit as hard as we can, taking full advantage of the 
shock value of these truly awful facts, and do everything reasonably possible 
to obtain a preliminary injunction stopping Broadwing's construction, or at 
the very least ordering them to stop construction (in Wyoming, and, if 
possible, in Colorado) until they have executed and complied with a 
construction coordination agreement.    

Broadwing Arguments:  1.  As to several cuts, EBS refused to even mark their 
line.

 Answer:  True, as to the first two cuts only, and even in those cases 
Broadwing's contractor continued ripping us up when they should have stopped; 
it is their obligation to protect our system, no matter what we do.

2.  EBS' line wasn't properly marked.  The line weaves left and right, and 
was marked as if it were laid in a straight line.

 Answer:  True, in some cases, but Broadwing's contractor was the same 
company that laid EBS' line only a few months earlier, and therefore knew the 
location of EBS' line.  Also, Broadwing knows that the sloping and rocky 
terrain causes the plow to wander somewhat, and Broadwing knew, especially 
after the first few cuts, that it was too close to EBS' line.

[Note to Dave:  Should we have named our own locating service?  We have 
discussed a claim against them, earlier, but I didn't think about whether 
they should have been named as a defendant.  What do you think?  It doesn't 
relate to the injunction, does it, but it does relate to the damage action.]

3.  EBS didn't have enough inspectors out to protect its system.

 Answer:  EBS did have inspectors nearby, though we cannot have a person with 
every plow at every minute.  In some cases where our inspector told the 
Broadwing contractor to stop work because the EBS cable was in danger of 
imminent harm, Broadwing did not stop, and the cable was cut.  So it isn't 
clear that more inspectors would have helped, since Broadwing ignored them 
anyway.

4.   Some cuts must be expected, when a cable is being laid close to an 
existing cable.

 Answer:  The number of Broadwing cuts (8 or 9, and growing!) is far and 
above the usual number that would be anticipated.  Clearly Broadwing has been 
negligent in its disregard for EBS' existing facility.  All Broadwing wants 
to do is the push through quickly.  Its contractors clearly behave in a 
negligent manner.  For example, when we hired Mears Construction in Texas, 
and they cut another company's cable, they stopped, and immediately examined 
the damage, contacted the cable's owner, and offered to repair the damage.  
When Mears was working for Broadwing in Wyoming, however, and Mears cut the 
EBS cable, Mears didn't contact EBS and kept on working, and even kept on 
damaging additional EBS facilities.

5.  EBS' damages are only its actual cost to repair the cuts.

 Answer:  No!  first, there have been so many cuts that EBS must in some 
cases replace entire segments of cable (because too many splice repairs 
results in too much communications signal loss), which is very expensive 
($275,000 per reel of cable).  Also, EBS is close to lighting its system 
(i.e., carrying traffic); when that happens, EBS' damages will be 
consequential:  lost profits, lost additional business, lost business 
reputation, etc.

6.  Uinta County is the true culprit, since it forced us to be only 3' away 
from EBS' cable.

 Answer:  It is true that the county's proximity requirement contributed to 
the problem.  That requirement is bad engineering practice, but results from 
the county's over-arching desire to maximize right of way revenue at all 
costs, without regard to actual construction realities.  Unfortunately, the 
county is immune.  Broadwing, however, is still responsible for protecting 
existing facilities, and is clearly responsible for all damages that result.  
There are numerous construction measures that Broadwing could and should have 
taken, to reduct the risk of damaging the EBS line:  for example, it should 
have dug periodic ""potholes"" to find out exactly where the line was, in order 
to avoid it.  It could have dug trenches to lay the cable, wherever it was 
too close for plowing.  In every case, Broadwing merely did what was easist 
and cheapest, without regard to EBS' line's security.  This is not acceptable 
construction practice; it is instead the practice of a fly-by-night operation 
that does not demonstrate basic regard for others' property.

7.   Broadwing is committed to avoiding any damage to EBS' facilities.

 Answer:  That is completely untrue.  While Broadwing has made numerous 
statements to EBS personnel which indicate that this is true, Broadwing's 
statements to EBS have repeatedly been proved to be either knowingly false 
statements or based on misunderstood inaccurate reports from its own field 
personnel.  Broadwing refused to sign, or even to negotiate, a ""construction 
coordination agreement"" which EBS supplied to Broadwing, which is designed to 
promote communication and cooperation, and prevent further damage.  (EBS 
signed such an agreement with AT&T, after EBS' contractor cut AT&T's cable.)

EBS has exhausted all its options with Broadwing, and must have relief from 
the court.  The timing of this hearing is critical, as EBS is about to light 
up its system, and cannot do so until the new cable is installed (to replace 
all the cut cable), and will suffer much greater damages once EBS traffic is 
interrupted.

I don't know if you saw my second e-mail, but I checked it out with Chris 
Mallory, who did the deal, and he verified the price at $214.95. If Prebon 
still disputes this, let me know and I'll have Mallory talk to Prebon.

The first priority is the rolls supporting the DPR information.  Also, please remember that all information needs to be reconciled to DPR information.  Please let Chris, Keith & myself know of your time frame to get us this info.  Currently, expectations are that we should have at least the rolls by the end of the week this week.

As we move into the Spring/Summer of 2000, it is time to turn our attention=
=20
to the performance review process.  Mid-year is always busy and we have a=
=20
number of important tasks and projects in process.  While recognizing this,=
=20
it remains extremely important to take time over the next few weeks to gath=
er=20
necessary information to provide quality and meaningful feedback for our=20
employees, as well as utilize this information during the year end review=
=20
process.

In the spirit of One Enron, the Performance Review Process (PRC) will be=20

ENA Mid-Year Process:

ENA has received favorable feedback on the review process used for Mid-year=
=20
and Year-end 1999, and as such, will follow the same general guidelines and=
=20
process for Mid-year 2000.  The following are key features of the Mid-year=
=20
2000 process:

o The focus of the feedback will continue to be on the qualitative aspects,=
=20
as opposed to quantitative.  Toward this end, communication of the employee=
=01,s=20
explicit ranking will be left to the discretion of the business unit manage=
r.
o Initial discussions with employees regarding their accomplishments, are=

highly encouraged, prior to the Business Review Meetings.
o Mid-year performance results will be used as baseline performance=20
information for Year-end 2000.
o Creation of 3 standard feedback forms for all peer groups. =20
o Standardization of criteria for all peer groups.
o   Utilization of a consistent 6 gradation rating scale. =20

o A minimum of two representatives from other functional areas will be=20
required at the Business Review Meetings.  The meetings should otherwise be=

=20
nominated individuals are illustrated below.
o The top 5 HR priorities/challenges for 2000 should also be agreed to at t=

Business Review Meetings.

As most of us are aware, Trasnco will be terminating all master commodity 
contracts effective 9/1/2000.  I don't think we should make any changes to 
the master contracts in our system until after the 1st.  However, we will 
need start adding the demand contracts to the East and Market East in 
Sitara.  Following is a list of master contracts and the associated demand 
contracts effective 9/1/2000.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

=20
is that the FERC will allow SC's with loads 200 MW or less to have up to 10=
=20
MW imbalance without penalty.  EPMI as a power marketer, has a highly=20
variable load, I assume.  Do we need to seek clarification from FERC or ISO=
=20
on how ISO will measure the load (annual average, annual peak, monthly peak=
?)=20
used to determine whether the applicable penalty threshold  is 10 MW or 5%?=
 =20
Guidance from traders would be appreciated.

b. Estimated bills
FERC allows the ISO to implement a blended ""automated/manual"" process to=20
implement the ISO's load imbalance penalty.  To simplify the settlement=20
process, the ISO is allowed to institute estimated billing procedures on a=
=20
temporary basis.  Does EPMI have a serious problem with being billed on an=
=20
estimated basis?

2. Documenting Incremental Seller Costs, Including Opportunity Costs

The FERC order raises important issues with regard to documenting our costs=
,=20
which will be required on all sales to the ISO or PX effective on 1/1/01.  =
In=20
its discussion of the $150/MWh breakpoint, FERC states: ""In recognition of=
=20
the unworkable complexities that the opportunity cost concept introduces in=
=20
the ISO real-time imbalance market, we will eliminate it.""  Enron will=20
undoubtedly raise the impermissibility of opportunity costs in its rehearin=
g=20
request.  Among other things, EPMI will  argue that opportunity costs are a=
=20
legitimate economic cost, that such costs are used in transmission pricing,=
=20
and that without such costs the FERC is essentially taking=20
generator/marketers back to cost-of-service ratemaking

This being said, EPMI must operate without the benefit of using opportunity=
=20
costs as a basis for documenting above-$150/MWh accepted bids effective=20
1/1/01.

As noted in the list of information that must be reported by Enron (see=20
Mary's summary or p. 59 of the FERC order), sellers that have not generated=
=20
their own power can report ""purchase price"".  Is West Trading prepared to=
=20
document every above-$150/MWh sale to the ISO or PX with an associated=20
""purchase price?""  In addition, other costs that clearly apply to a=20
marketer--such as transmission access costs, transmission losses, expected=
=20
replacement power costs, start-up/no-load costs--are not allowed on the=20
list.  (We should not the omission of these costs in our petition for=20
rehearing.)

In several places in the order, the Commission states that sellers should b=
e=20
allowed to earn reasonable profits but little guidance is given.  The only=
=20
concrete guidance I found was in Massey's concurring opinion which identifi=
ed=20
$25/MWh as a ""reasonable capacity adder.""

Accepted bids below $150/MWh do not require documentation.  The preliminary=
=20
opinion from our discussion today was that such bids are in a =01&safe harb=
or=018=20
zone and it appears that refund risk on such transactions is much less.

Here's the forecast that you asked for, updated for reported actuals, mid-Columbia spill participation and an assumption that the current drastic efforts to refill continue through June 10. Not included is the rumored 400 MW-mo of federal lower Columbia spill that's been considered for the May to mid-June time frame. "

All,

Attached, for your information, is  a copy of a general presentation that I

that will become a ""living"" document to communicate our businesses and 
growth.  I will be making numerous changes as we move closer to the analyst 
meeting in January but I wanted to give everyone a copy of this version.

Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or comments.

Hello everyone,

Hope you all are doing well.
I believe the Cross Timbers rebooking nitemare has finally come to an end!
All we need to do now is send out the revised confirms.

Accounting:
Below is a list of deal numbers that were either changed, killed, or created.
I believe this is everything.

Please let me know if I seem to be missing any deals or if you have any questions.

Best Regards and THANK YOU to everyone who has contributed to this 'project'!

When the Commercial Transactions Group was created approximately a year ago=

assure that new transactions (a) incorporate appropriate risk/return=20
characteristics, (b) are evaluated in the context of market based pricing=

signals, and (c) incorporate a specific investment plan which includes=20
syndication of the investment, if applicable, and a specific exit strategy.=
 =20
Portfolio Management includes Restructuring/Special Assets (Randy=20
Maffett/Dick Lydecker) and Capital Structuring (Andrea Reed).  Steve Pruett=
=20
(Energy Capital Resources), Chuck Ward (Generation Investments), Don Miller=

to be responsible for day to day asset management for performing investment=

and will report to their respective origination units with a dual report to=

All responses to this e-mail should be sent to kenneth.lay@enron.com

Dear Colette:

 In response to your e-mail concerning the upcoming New Delhi World Forum, I 
would expect that this forum should evaluate the impact of what is happening 
on our project at Dabohl with reference to enticing other foreign 
investment.  As you probably know, the State of Maharastra has been slow 
paying and no paying for the electricity from our plant at Dabohl for 
sometime and more recently both the State of Maharastra  and the Government 
of India have refused to honor their government guarantees on this project.  
We have filed a political force majeure on the project and indeed will be 
moving into arbitration on that and a number of other issues in London in the 
not too distant future.  Again, I believe this will send a very negative 
signal to the market place as to the advisability of international companies 
investing in India.  I would think you might want to build one panel around 
this subject.  

 If there's any way we can be of help, let me know.

Best regards,

Ken Lay

Subject: India Economic Summit 2001, New Delhi 2-4 December


To the attention of:
Dr Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman
Enron


Dear Dr Lay,

When the Minister of Finance of India Yashwant Sinha recently presented the
2001-2002 national budget, it was widely acknowledged as a very ambitious
""dream budget"" which puts India on a high growth trajectory. Most key
sectors should benefit from these reforms, which will thus give a new boost
to the country's economic and social progress. As such, the budget was
welcomed with great enthusiasm by the Indian and international business
community.

On the occasion of our India Economic Summit 2001 to be held in partnership
with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) from 2 to 4 December in New
Delhi, it will be the perfect time to assess the progress of the bold and
extensive measures proposed in the recent budget, how they have been
implemented and how they have impacted the business environment, domestic
industry activity and foreign investment.

As we will soon be preparing the preliminary programme of the Summit, I
would like to take the opportunity to benefit from your expertise and
understanding of the country. I would greatly appreciate receiving from you
any particular topics or issues that you wish to see given priority on the
agenda. Any suggestions of relevant speakers or experts that you may have
would also be welcomed.

I look forward to receiving your response at the above e-mail address and
kindly ask you to copy my colleague Mitra Khoubrou (e-mail:
mitra.khoubrou@weforum.org).

For more information on the 2001-2002 Union Budget, please visit the
website of the Ministry of Finance of India at http://finmin.nic.in/fub.htm

I look forward to hearing from you and hope that you will be with us in
India again next December.

Best regards,

Colette Mathur,
Director,
Center for Regional Strategies
World Economic Forum

Per the documents below that were sent to you on October 10th regarding Enron's RTO positions, please DO NOT DISTRIBUTE them.  Unfortunately, there were factual errors that were not identified until today.  
 
I will send everyone a replacement set next week.  
 
Thank you and I apologize for the confusion.

Attached are five documents which articulate Enron's position on various RTO issues.  Each document is short (no more than 5 pages) and can be used as talking points, or handouts in your meetings with policy makers.
 
If you have previous drafts of these documents, please replace them with the attached FINAL versions.
 
If you have questions about these documents or suggestions for future topics, please contact me with your ideas. 
 
Thank you.

Security/Reliability (industry changes/drivers which call for renewed commitment to reliability) 
Q&A (general FAQs addressing RTOs) 
Natural Markets (explanation of physical flows of electricity which justify FERC RTO model) 
Chronology (history of FERC actions leading up to Chairman Wood's comments on September 26)

Dan,
Lisa,

I am assuming we have not heard anything from Cage, and it has been 12 days 
since we sent them the letter notifying of the amounts they owe us.

I guess we can move on to the next step.

Please advise,

Russell

Hello to the Direct Access Coalition:

Below you will find a summary of the press strategy that Edelman Public
Relations intends to employ over the coming weeks in collaboration with the
Alliance for Retail Energy Markets and the broader Direct Access Coalition.
I will also outline the information that I need from Direct Access Coalition
members who are willing to be involved in media outreach and interviews.
And finally, I have attached supporting documents that you can use as
background material to prep for your responses to any media inquiries that
you may receive.

This Week

1.   We are drafting a ""pitch letter"" to send out by the end of this week
via blast e-mail and fax to the following media lists: 1)capitol press corps
reporters; 2) mainstream media reporters working the energy crisis; and 3)
trade media.  We may also outreach to our editorial board list as well.  Our
pitch will be focused on what it will really mean for small business and C&I
customers to lose the option of retail choice at a time when they are
suffering the financial hardships of skyrocketing energy bills. We will
address the effect on California's future business climate if direct access
is not preserved through legislation that corrects the problems that AB1x
caused for retail choice.  And finally, we will address the point that no
matter what direction California ultimately takes, direct access must be a
part of the solution.  Reporters have seen the recent polls which illustrate
California businesses' concerns with the path the state is on so this is a
prime opportunity to build on those recent media stories.

2.    We recommend a conference call with AReM and the Direct Access
Coalition on Friday to address the questions and suggestions on the press
strategy outlined here.

3.     Determine which people in the Direct Access Coalition are willing to
take media calls on behalf of the coalition.

Next Week

1.   Follow up with key reporters who received the pitch letter.

2.   Evaluate the language of SB 27x and determine whether there will be an
opportunity to hold a news conference with Sen. Bowen in the near future.
Monitor movement at the PUC and determine whether a press conference may be
effective in this arena, or whether we may need to use the option of sending
a media alert before the March 7 hearing, followed by a news release after
the hearing.

3.   Place op-eds (opinion pieces) with key newspapers.

4.   Contact radio news shows and TV public affairs shows (i.e. California
Capitol Week and the California Report) to secure
media interviews.

5.    Revise the SB 27x fact sheet (attached) to reflect the realities of
the amended language in SB 27x.

 What We Need From You

1.  If you are willing to speak with the media, or you have
customers/clients with a positive direct access story to tell, please
respond to this email as soon as you can with your name and contact
information.

2.  If you have draft op-eds written that need to be placed with newspapers
on behalf of your association and the broader coalition, we are willing to
do this for the you.

3.  If you have colleagues and/or staff that are already working with the
media it would be helpful to have this information so that we can
collaborate as necessary.

As Mike Day has indicated, we are 99% sure the CPUC will bifurcate the PX 
credit payment and DA suspension issues, and vote only on DA suspension on 
Thursday.  This gives more time to work on a SCE PX credit stipulation.

		 Subject: ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE - CPUC Decision

Harry & Sue --

Please work with Mike Day on Monday am to develop the following -

1. Outline of a proposed SCE - Enron - WPTF Stipulation that resolves SCE's 
request for suspension of payment of PX Credit.
2. Talking points for Jeff Skilling to call Bryson to discuss.

Get these to Skilling through Rick early Monday so that he can call.  
Skilling is going to try and convince SCE to settle and not let the CPUC 
decide this issue.

I know it's a long-shot on getting a deal done and before the CPUC on 
Wednesday, but this may be our last best hope to hold this element of the 
Proposed Decision.

Call me on Monday am to discuss (I'll be in DC).

Thanks,

Jim

At Drew's request, I am delivering this message to confirm that under 
referenced contract, which we plan to have executed tomorrow, ENA will not be 
liable for payment of the contract price (or any part thereof), or any 
cancellation charges, or any other fees, charges or costs, unless and until  
ENA delivers to ABB a notice to proceed (""NTP""), which is entirely within 
ENA's discretion.  ENA has until December 1, 2000 to give NTP.  If ENA does 
not give NTP to ABB on or before that date, the contract automatically 
terminates, without any liability to ENA. 

 ENA may also, at its discretion, cancel the contract at any time.  If ENA 
cancels before NTP is given, ENA pays no cancellation charges or any other 
payment, and has no liability under the contract.

This appears clear to me. We do not hold any risk with the CNV unless we
create it.

Mark do we need any further clarification from your perspective?

The worst would be we are warned, asked to make a change or shut down. I do
not have anything to loose in an emerging market with limited liquidity
already. It would be different if there was an existing business that would
be harmed. This is all incremental value from today.

MFG

I do not doubt that the government can order the utilities to keep supplying
electricity, but I think the federal government is now the guarantor of
payment.  See the Supreme Court's 1996 decision in the Winstar case.

Subject:	iBuyit Program

To All -

Just a follow-up message to each of you about the iBuyit program.  

I am still in need of a designated volunteer from each of your groups to act as a Change Agent for this program.  Since it is a Corp. initiative and will be implemented over time, I need to make sure all areas of the Legal Dept. are on board.  

Please provide me with the name of at least one person within your group who fits the Change Agent bill.  For those that have forgotten, the Change Agent is defined as follows:

""individuals who are highly respected within their area and known as the 'GO TO' people among their peers.""

Their responsibilities are:

- to disseminate communications regarding the project
- to develop awareness and ownership of the product among their department
- to encourage use of the product
- identify those who will need training
- encourage peer training attendance 
- engage in rumor control (basically relay the facts of the program and not the myths (e.g., the product will replace jobs))

Information needs to be distributed to these individuals as soon as possible so that they can be prepared for demonstrations of the iBuyit product next week.

Thanks for your assistance.

If any of you have any questions, please let me know.

Many Thanks,

Greg -

Thanks for giving some additional thought to sending an Enron representative 
to
Chase H&Q's Energy and the New Economy conference. I think your suggestion of
Mike McConnell is great  -- in fact I saw a piece on energy e-business in
Sunday's Chronicle in which Mike was heavily quoted albeit in his former role 
as
CEO of Enron Global Technologies. I don't know Mike well but met him a couple 
of
times in London in connection with a financing that Chase led on the TGTL
situation.

Anyway, you had asked about other presenters and format.

The format will be a panel dicussion during which each company will give a 10 
-
15 minute business overview probably in a powerpoint format with books for
audience members to take away. Following the formal presentations there will 
be
questions both from the floor and from the moderator to be addressed by all
panel members.

Assuming that EnronOnline is able to participate on the Energy Exchange panel
the moderator will be yours truly -- so I'll be serving up some softballs for
Mike.

The other confirmed panelists for the Energy Exchange session are:

Houstonstreet.com -- Howard Smith
Enemetrix.com - John Gaus
Downstream.com - John Ireland

We are expecting good attendance from industry (both incumbants as well as new
economy types) as well as from the buyside. So far there are over 100
participants and I expect we see a number of additional confirmations between
now and the conference.

Logistically, Mike would need to fly to San Francisco on Wed Sept 20 -- we 
will
work with him on transport up to Silverado Resort in Napa Valley. The panel 
will
be first thing on Thursday Spet 21 (probably around 9 am) after which Mike 
will
be free to attend other conference sessions, play golf, tour wineries or
whatever.

The full list of sessions  includes:

Distributed Generation
Communications
B2B
Investor Perspectives
Energy Exchanges
Energy Retail
Venture Stage
European New Energy

Subject: Re:  

Bobby retires this month, but will continue as a consultant to Enron India.  
His stated intention is to shadow Clay and his team to help arrange LNG 
supplies for Metgas.  We do not need this and it adds a layer of confusion 
whenever he is in attendance in negotiations, but to date neither Wade nor 
Sanjay has been willing or able to control this.  The India group tends to 
blame their failure to market Metgas supplies on the LNG team's ""failure"" to 
get better terms, and they insist that Bobby or others attend the meetings to 
ensure that we are doing a good job.

We believe that we have obtained LNG for Metgas on favorable terms, 
particularly in light of the fact that we have convinced Malaysia and Abu 
Dhabi to accept the credit risk of Metgas customers, i.e., with no Ennron 
support in the middle and no Indian government support behind the buyers).  
They believe that our supplies are priced 50 cents above the ""market"", which 
they perceive to be Qatari supplies to Petronet ( a proposed 
government-backed LNG import project in Western India that is a long way from 
being real).    

We believe that we know the pricing terms for the proposed Petronet deal and 
that the price is not as low as rumored.  We also believe that the Metgas 
customers are willing to pay the price that we have negotiated and that the 
Metgas pipeline economics are sound (although the India group has been 
unwilling to share their economics with us) and that, once the LNG contracts 
are in place, we can reduce the LNG price significantly via a backhaul from 
Malaysia using ADGAS/TEPCO ships.   We can further reduce the price if we can 
get access to the spare capacity on the ship dedicated to DPC and use it to 
move incremental cargoes from Abu Dhabi to Metgas.

Bobby and his team want us to reopen the price in the Mayasia term sheet.  We 
do not intend to do this.  Malaysia has told us that they will walk the deal 
if we insist on a lower price.  Malaysia recently sold additional volumes to 
Japan for a price about 20 cents higher than the price to Metgas and they 
believe they can also sell our volumes at a higher price to more creditworthy 
buyers in the far east.

The Malaysia COI includes a cp that Metgas will finalize contracts with its 
end buyers by Sep 1999.  We have repeatedly  gotten Malaysia to extend this 
target date, which is now end October 2000, but Malaysia is getting impatient 
with India and I am not sure how much longer we can hold this together 
without some more firm evidence from India that the markets are real

I will be in India on Oct 4/5 to meet with Sanjay and Wade to discuss this.  
We will also try to finalize the terms for us to provide LNG  fuel management 
and shipping services to both DPC and Metgas, and will seek clarification 
from Wade/Sanjay as to how they intend to sell down DPC/Metgas without losing 
control of the LNG terminal.  Clay, V V RAo and Wayne Perry will be with me.

Working with India is never easy

Rick

  I took several assignments from the last World Hunger call.  Status as 
follows:

a.   Tax language-  I have sent a prior version of Rev 4 jr to Matt G asking 
him to call me to let me know when he can talk with GE tax rep.  Steve Swifit 
and I are in London and would like to sit in on that call.

b.   Insurance Language review.   I sent same version to David Marshall and 
Paul Parrish asking for their reviews and opinion as to whether 7FA's are new 
technology.

c.   I ""volunteered"" to look at the termination language in world hunger, GE 
had some problems, and I had the same problem with the ARCOs contract.   I 
drafted a fix last Friday, sent to Kay M for comment.  I have included my 
suggested changes in the attached redline.  I have forwarded same fix to GE 
at end Friday for Arcos.    I have asked Kay if she still has a concern with 
the Limit of Liability as it relates to termination.  I think it works.

d.  I ""volunteered"" to work over Article 10, Exhibit B-3 and Exhibit B-6 in 
relation to Guarantees and liquidated damages.  I have done that in the 
attached redline of the T&C and Exhibits.

e. Some time ago I volunteered to resurrect the language associated with the 
reduction in the LD refund in Section 10.9.8.   I had sent out a couple weeks 
ago but received no reaction.    I have entered that fix in the attached 
redline.

f.  I have made several minor changes to definitions associated with 
performance.

Attached is Rev4-JR version of GE T&C's and Exhibits for world hunger.  They 
start from the clean rev 4 version of the T&Cs that Peter forwarded to me at 
my request.  The attached are redlined to show my changes.

I have not sent any of this to GE except for the termination language fix.   
I suggest that the Enron team give these a quick read before the World hunger 
call.  I can print same here and share with GE during the call unless there 
is an objection.  

I hope this will help to advance the process.  My earlier emails to Paul and 
Matt were not intended confuse the situation with different drafts.  Please 
ignore those and for the above purposes use the attached files.


Kay- I suggest that you forward to others who you feel appropriate for the 
purposes of the world hunger call on Wednesday.

that are worth a look.

Beth Jenkins is a senior commercial person with extensive derivatives

Attached are the S. 420 and HR 333 as passed, respectively, by the Senate and 
the House.  As you know, the bills are prepared to go to conference, however 
Senate leadership has not yet figured out how they will organize the 
conference.

The language of interest to you is located in Title IX, Sec. 901(d), found on 
page 292 of HR 333 and on page 307 of S. 420.

Carol - While it never too late to suggest a change, given the political 
situation I would be hesitant to offer anything more than a ""clarification"".  
While I would not spend a huge amount of time on it, I suggest you examine if 
there are any changes. Depending on what happens in the Senate (now that it 
is in Democratic hands), the process can be reopened and we could have an 
opportunity to offer suggested changes (or it kill the bill all together).

Subject: RE: Star VPP

Met with Pam and here is the deal.  Pam wants the P&L for the April deals to 
show up in May GL.  What I suggested to her was that rather than do anything 
for the deals in risk or Portfolio that Pam defer the P&L on her company and 
release it the next month.  This keeps things normal in our worlds and Pam 
controls when she sees the P&L on her company.  She has agreed to do this.

There will be a new twist starting in July.  Starr is supposed to become 3rd 
party and the payment date is supposedly two months after the fact.  Pam is 
checking with legal to see if there is to be a complete unwind and rebooking 
because of structure changes to make the deal 3rd party or if we can just 
change the counterparty on the deals.  I'm sure we will be the last to know 
as usual.

FYI.  See highlighted comments below.  Don't know if you've heard, but there's considerable talk about Davis trying to get the bonds out via Executive Order.  How that might work technically is unclear---at the end of the day, Lynch & Co. have to approve any ratepayer funds used to service the bonds.  Perhaps Davis is thinking about shifting the burden to taxpayers generally.  In off line conversations with JP Morgan people, they're saying the Executive Order route is ""doable,"" but they ain't giving any details.  We're trying to find out more.
Alternative SDG&E debt plan to get hearings 
Approval of the governor's plan for paying the $747 million debt SDG&E says it is owed by its customers appeared less certain yesterday, as the president of the state utilities commission said she planned to hold public hearings for an alternative proposal. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said in a local radio interview that regulators will hold hearings in San Diego regarding a plan from consumer groups that purports to save customers about $185 million more than the governor's proposal. 
The groups said the earlier plan negotiated between the governor and the utility would be costly for consumers and a windfall for San Diego Gas & Electric. 
At stake is how much SDG&E contributes and how much customers pay toward the debt, which accumulated in a so-called balancing account when SDG&E paid more for electricity than it was able to collect from customers during the power crisis. 
Despite the plan for hearings, Lynch told KPBS-FM radio that the commission would make a final decision about how to resolve the controversial $747 million debt by November. 
The governor and SDG&E announced their plan in June, saying it required the utility to contribute $319 million toward the debt and eliminated the balancing account without lengthy litigation or raising rates. 
Consumer groups, led by the San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, say the governor's plan does not go far enough, particularly because SDG&E earned an estimated $400 million in profits from the sale of electricity during the power crisis. 
Under the governor's plan, those profits are awarded to the company's shareholders, though SDG&E would use $219 million from the profits as part of its $319 million contribution toward the debt. 
Under the consumer groups' plan, SDG&E would be allowed to keep some of the profits, but it would contribute $72 million more than it would under the governor's plan. The alternative plan also would require the utility to make other monetary concessions. 
In a formal decision earlier this year, the California utilities commission said SDG&E's profits do belong to customers. SDG&E has sued to overturn the decision in court, but it has put the litigation on hold pending the utilities commission's resolution of the plan to pay the debt. 
Michael Shames, executive director of UCAN, said yesterday that he was encouraged by Lynch's call for hearings on the consumer plan. 
""There is $400 million at stake here,"" Shames said. 
SDG&E said yesterday that it had not received formal notification about the hearings, nor had it yet seen the alternative plan for paying the debt. 
A spokesman for the utility, however, repeated earlier comments that the company saw the alternative plan as an attempt to derail the PUC's process of considering the governor's plan. 
Lynch also said yesterday that the utilities commission would continue to challenge the more than $40 billion in long-term electricity contracts signed by the state during the crisis. 
Lynch said the agreements bind the state to overpriced power and are in violation of federal law requiring electricity rates to be ""just and reasonable."" 
The utilities commission president said the contracts may be even more expensive than earlier thought because at least some of the power they bind California to purchase is not needed. The extra costs would damage businesses and family budgets, she said. 
""If you have to pay three to four times more for energy, you don't have the money to grow your business or meet other needs of your family,"" Lynch said. 
She also defended action by the commission last week that effectively delayed the sale of $12.5 billion in state bonds needed to pay power costs. Lynch said the commission supported a legislative proposal for floating the bonds, which would separate them from the long-term power contracts."

therefore, we are not prepared to sign that.

Hope that helps.

Before I get legal and PR to look at this could you give me a bit more 
background on the potential arrangement with NextSet. I dont understand where 
the need for training will come in. 

I know that generally Enron has a policy of not being seen to endorse a 
client's products. PR may therefore have a problem with giving NextSet the 
ability to put our logo on their site. How important is this likely to be ?

Gillian and George,

Thanks again for stopping by this morning.  Per our conversation, I am
attaching a mutual NDA and a standard LOI.  With the former in place, we
should both be able to get a little deeper into the technology to see if
there is a strong fit between our respective companies.  I would be very
interested to introduce our CTO with your technology counterpart the next
time he is in town.  Feel free to schedule that meeting through me.  All the
best.

It's about a new hire in my group and I wanted advice.  Easier to talk in

Mark,
 
According to the listing agent, the annual gross income for this unit is $22,800.  This is actual income from the past year. Expect this year to be somewhat less.  Also, a contract has been offered on this property, but not yet accepted.  I'm going over there to take a look today.

Another key point:  to avoid the mistakes of California, policy makers must 
make it easy to site and interconnect new generation.  In California peak 
demand rose by about 5500 MW from 1996 - 2000.  The market responded with 
porposed capacity additions of about 11000 MW.  Most of these facilities are 
working thier way through the tangle of state and local approvals.  The 
problems we saw in California did not need to occur if policy makers simply 
enabled the market to work.  Also, it's worth noting that the deregulated 
market did work.  Customers who signed with Enron saw a lower bill than 
prederegulation, Enron hedged its commitments and so our customers (and 
Enron) did just fine during the summer.  Deregulation worked; the problems in 
California can be directly traced to continued regulatory interference in the 
market.

Mark,

Here's my shot.  I did it in Revision mode so you can see the changes.  Note 
that Enron never got out of the retail market in CA and has gathered about 
1,000 MW of retail load -- we're bigger than all but two of the municipal 
utilities in the state.  Enron stopped marketing to residential consumers -- 
that's what all the  fuss was about in 1997.  Anyone else feel free to take 
your own shot.

Sue

Some of our people get asked on the phone about what is going on in 
California.  I have drafted the attached paper for their use.  It is intended 
to be simple and user-friendly.  Your thoughts on whether I achieved that 
objectvie are welcome.  More importantly, I need you to confimr that I got 
the story and facts correct, and that I have not said anything about the 
situation that you (Enron USA) would not want to say, or have not said, or if 
we have said something fundamentally different, I need to know that, too.   
thanks for taking the time to review.  mcs

As a valued member of the INVESTools community, you've
asked to be notified about new investment tools, features,
and money-saving opportunities from INVESTools and our
strategic partners.  We think you'll be interested in this
exciting offer from Phillips Publishing Inc.

To unsubscribe, see the link at the end of this email.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Investor,

So far you've missed 69% gains.  Wait any longer, and you'll miss the
best shot at a ten-bagger you'll ever get!

A while back I wrote to you about what I call ""the biggest lie in
technology today""...

...and offered you a FREE bulletin on the ONE stock best positioned for
enormous gains, as this story unfolds.  A stock that could easily DOUBLE
your money in short order...and then make your fortune several times
over in the next few years.

To me, it's CRAZY that I haven't heard back from you.  After all, this
is an entirely FREE piece of information--with no obligation on your
part.  You have nothing to lose.  And--judging by our gains so far--a
pile of money to make.

Since I started pounding the table for this stock after the September
crisis, it's UP 69%!  But DON'T WORRY.  There's still time to get in on
the lion's share of the gains.  The really BIG PROFITS--3 or 4-times
what we've made so far--will come as the economy recovers this year.
And that's why the perfect time to buy this POWERHOUSE company is NOW.

IN JUST A MOMENT, I'll tell you how to get the name of this stock,
complete details and my full ""buy instructions""--absolutely FREE,
without obligation of any kind.

But first, it's imperative that you know the truth about technology's
biggest lie: The so-called ""glut"" of fiber optic cable.

WHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet slowed down--very
noticeably slowed down.  In fact, it nearly came to a grinding halt!
That means there isn't enough capacity or redundancy built into the
system to accommodate a blip in demand.

Sources tell me that the government is very worried about this problem.
After all, this is the second time it's happened.  Back in July, a
tunnel fire in Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full
days.

That means our communications systems--and therefore our economy--are
very, very vulnerable.  And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than
99.9% of Americans even begin to understand.  Here's one example.

Qwest--one of America's biggest carriers--recently said they're 60%
loaded on their network.  That doesn't sound too bad...until you
understand how these networks operate.  You can't load a network much
past 65%.  In fact, 70% is virtually catastrophic--because the network
spends so much time searching for open channels, it doesn't spend any
time actually sending packets of information.

The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation comes to a
standstill.  And business, the economy and our national security all go
in the CRAPPER.

BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a ""fiber glut?""  Because
 95% of all the fiber that has ever been laid is ""dark""--that is, it's
not activated.  And the company I'm recommending is the #1 supplier of
the components needed to do the job.  I'm looking at a DOUBLE--possibly
a TRIPLE by this time next year.  And I fully expect to multiply our
money five-times over by 2007.  In fact, this stock truly has
""ten-bagger"" potential!

So get in on the action.  Click on the link below to get the name of
this stock--This TOP PICK is absolutely FREE and without obligation, but
only for a limited time.  It's my way of introducing you to my
award-winning Technology Investing advisory--but there's no obligation
of any kind.

I think you'll find this FREE offer well worth your while.  In 1999--the
last time tech stocks started from such depressed levels--my clients
earned 157%, as verified by The Hulbert Financial Digest.  And that
earned us Hulbert's #1 RANKING for all investment advisories!

So far, we've made 69% in this fiber-optics POWERHOUSE since
mid-September.  You've missed out so far.  Don't miss out on the much
BIGGER GAINS to come,

At the height of the boom, this company's stock was nearly 20-times
higher.  But then the economy tanked and spending on communications
networks dried up.  Now the government is ready to pump $100 billion in
emergency spending into the economy; interest rates are practically
zero; and the need isn't just vital for the economy anymore--it's a
question of NATIONAL SECURITY!  That's why this next move up will be so
powerful.

Please don't miss out.

You've got nothing to lose by taking advantage of this FREE--no strings
attached--introductory offer.  Click here to sign up now:

http://www.ppi-orders.com/index.htm?promo_code=0ML232

Sincerely,

Michael Murphy
TECHNOLOGY INVESTING

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS OUT on.  This
""ten-bagger"" has a long ways to run--but it's already UP 69% since
mid-September, in recognition of this company's vital new role in
national security.

Dark fiber does no good.  Actual carrying capacity is strained to the
limits.  And get this--data traffic is DOUBLING every year now.  That
means a network running at 63% of capacity needs to double its load by
this time next year just to keep up.  That's why the fiber must be lit.
That's why the fiber will be lit.  Click here to take advantage of this
FREE opportunity now.

Today the Commission issued the following orders pertaining to transmission interconnection:

AEP -- Order granting rehearing on issue of interest on transmission credits for network upgrades (ER01-2163):  Commission reversed its July 26 decision in which it  refused to require AEP to pay interest on credits for system upgrades.  The Commission noted that it will be initiating a generic rulemaking in the near future on interconnection procedures.  However, in the interim, its policy is that ""the addition of an interest payment in connection with system upgrades is appropriate.""

NYISO - Cost responsibility for new interconnections.  (ER01-2967):  The Commission approved tariff changes by NYISO allocating cost responsibility for interconnection facilities.  The provisions allocate to developers 100% of the cost of facilities necessary to physically interconnect the project.  Additionally, developers are allocated the coswts for transmission system upgrades that would not have been made ""but for"" the interconnection, minus the cost of any facilities that the NYISO's regional plan dictates would have been necessary anyway for load growth and reliability purposes.  

Please contact me if you need further information.

Paul......I talked with Frank at NYISO. He said that you are able to get the invoice info off of their website. Just go to OASIS/bidding and scheduling/user login. I believe you were going to admin login earlier. Anyway, can you take a look at it and let me know what you find? Thanks.

As you will read in the message below, CERA is still making some final revisions to this report regarding its figures on interest on DWR debt.  I will forward the final paper on to you as soon as I get it.  

Attached is the first version of the report - numbers in this report may not be final.

Jennifer, 
We have revised the analysis with the June 19 FERC Order, so that sum has changed. Through 2005 the figure is closer to $8 billion according to our estimates. That number includes carrying charges (at a borrowing rate of 6 percent) on total utility debt associated with buying energy in California up to this point, and past and future energy purchases by the state. 
I've seen a couple public estimates of this number other than our own but don't have the sources in hand. The state Controller Kathleen Connell has not shared the Governor's rosy views on the energy crisis and may have a realistic number out there. Let me know if you need more detail on this.
Sorry for the delayed response. I was on vacation last week.

In response to your inquiry about the availability of the paper ""Short 
Circuit: Will the California Energy Crisis Derail the State's Economy?"", 
currently we are updating the analysis to incorporate the effects of the 
June 19 FERC Order implementing price caps. The paper will be available 
some time next week through the CERA website. 
Please don't hesitate to call with other questions.

Rick, thanks for the note. I will be in touch with you and Stefan Diescher on 
this. The issue I have been faced with, however, is 
simply this: I am covering power and gas for three countries on my own. The 
demands on my time have been enormous and I have given
Viviana as much of my time as possible. Indeed, at the last PRC, there was 
significant pressure to place her in the ""has issues"" category
and I resisted on the grounds that she needed more time to find her stride. 
We have had a number of long meetings where I have noted
in detail what my expectations are and provided her with suggestions on how 
to improve. This has included helping her outline a research paper
how to write a slide presentation, what research sources to go to, how to 
extract information from people on the phone. In a better world
I would spend more time with her to bring her along, but I am horribly 
stretched and need a researcher who is more effective to help
me get the job done. I have also gotten other feedback (including from the 
head of the Frankfurt office) that has been rather negative.
My view is that rather than prolong the mutual agony, we should begin the 
process of managing her out and helping her secure more
appropriate employment outside the firm. Please let me know what you think.
Thanks, Paul

I heard more about Viviana before I left London last week and apparently her 
concern she was'nt being properly guided or mentored- despite her apparent 
current performance and your  lack of time, I think we do owe her an action 
plan at mid-year at the latest and a decent opportunity to redeem herself. 
Please let me know how I can be of assistance. Thanks.

Colleen, this is the email response I received.  

Kim, could you find out from payables if we are making payments to a company 
called ""Capacity Center""?  If we are, I would like to know who with Enron is 
authorizing these payments.

Thanks.

Sara,

Procter & Gamble has proposed that we start negotiating using their ISDA 
schedule.  Enclosed is a note (that addresses a few critical issues) from my 
business counterpart and a draft schedule.

P&G is the largest buyer of pulp and containerboard in North America - two 
key commodities for our business.  Executing a Master with them is very 
important.  If at all possible, I would like to accomodate their requests to 
negotiate from their schedule.

However, as you know, I am not a lawyer.  Please review and share your 
thoughts with me.  Thanks.

Ed Quinn

Ed-

As promised, I have attached our standard ISDA Schedule.  All bank and 
non-bank
(commodity financial instrument) counterparties with whom we transact have
signed essentially the same ISDA Schedule without non-reliance and set off or
cross default.  As I have discussed previously, I think that it is beneficial 
to
both of us to work directly versus sleeving transactions through a third 
party.
Given our credit limit policies, we will require some form of credit 
enhancement
from you, but I think that cost effective alternatives exist beyond using 
banks
as stand-in counterparties.

I realize that our approach may differ from other companies, but I think that 
we
can dramatically assist in the development of the pulp and paper financial
instrument market.  Certainly, as Enron is an important market maker, we would
like to be in position to transact a significant portion of our volume with 
you.
Net, very positive results for both of our companies.

I will be interested in your response to the attached schedule.

Regards

Roger

Longhorns Will Wrap Up Spring Football Drills Wednesday

The Longhorns worked out in shorts Monday, and coach Mack Brown said the
tea=
m=20
will practice Tuesday at? 4 p.m. and then scrimmage Wednesday, probably at
5=
=20
p.m., to wrap up what he termed ""our best spring? since we've been here.""
Brown said the Tuesday practice will be at the Denius Fields and the=20
Wednesday scrimmage will be at Royal Memorial Stadium. He said he would=20
announce a time for the scrimmage at Tuesday's practice.
NCAA rules require that three of the 15 spring practices be in shorts,
and=20
Brown said that was the reason the team practiced in shorts Monday. ""We=20
practiced in shorts the first two days, and we had to get a third day in=20
shorts,"" he said.
The Horns worked primarily on their passing game because it's hard to do
muc=
h=20
on the running game in shorts. QB Chris Simms continued to look very
sharp,=20
and sophomore TEs Bo Scaife and Brock Edwards both made several
outstanding=20
catches. Everyone knows about the Longhorns' fine WRs, but there won't be
a=20
better pair of TEs in the Big 12 than Scaife and Edwards. There might not
be=
=20
a better pair in the country.
Brown said the Longhorns will have more speed on defense this season
than=20
they have had since he got here. ""Everything we're doing is trying to get
th=
e=20
fastest guys on the field,"" he said, noting that former LB O. J.
McClintock=20
is doing a good job of pass rushing at DE, and former DE Maurice Gordon
is=20
doing the same at DT.=20
""In each case, those moves were made to increase our speed,"" he said.
* * * *
If you saved the class chart in my March 12 newsletter, take a look at
the=20
players in each class and see how many top hands you see. I did that
today=20
and I counted nine fine players in the sophomore class, plus three others
wh=
o=20
might be fine players, too. No other class has more than five, although
the=20
12 redshirted freshmen might produce more than that.
I'm not going to identify the guys who I think are really good in each
class=
=20
because then it would be obvious which starters I don't think are really=20
good. I try to avoid being overly critical of any of the kids,? so I
would=20
suggest you look at the class chart, too, and see how you think the
various=20
classes rank.
One other important thing to note is that senior CB Quentin Jammer is an=20
outstanding player who is projected to be the first defensive back picked
in=
=20
the next NFL draft. But he has a very hard time covering either of the=20
Longhorns' pair of star sophomore wide receivers (Roy Williams and B. J.=20
Johnson) on a consistent basis.
Opposing teams usually double cover Williams, which means Johnson and
the=20
tight ends draw single coverage. That is going to make the Longhorns'
passin=
g=20
game more potent than ever this season.
Scaife is regaining the form he showed last spring before injuring his
knee=20
during the pre-season workouts. If he hadn't missed last season, I think
the=
=20
Longhorns would have gone 11-1. Obviously, he wouldn't have made that
much=20
difference in the 63-14 loss to Oklahoma, but I think he would have made
a=20
big difference in the narrow losses to Stanford and Oregon. The
Longhorns=20
were building their passing offense around him before his injury, and he=20
would have helped buy time for the true freshmen wide receivers to begin=20

Peter:

As we have discussed, I think we probably need someone other than Dan.  I 
don't think there is any need to lay everything out on use of lawyers in 
Canada.  I agree with your comments on the business model for lawyers.  We 
can't ignore that.  Let's generally talk that through with Jim.

Regards,

Mark

		 Subject: Canadian Counsel

Mark, a few thoughts:

1.  Dan Fournier asked me to go to lunch so he could update me on his ""very 
positive meeting"" with Jim and you.  I told Dan, politely, that I am very 
tired of talking to the issue and really have nothing more to add.  I hope 
that is OK with you.  To be honest, I am really tired of talking to the issue 
and dealing with Dan Fournier's political maneuvering, but I am also 
concerned that it seems apparent that the result of his meeting with you and 
Jim is that he thinks he is back in the saddle with Enron.  I have lost trust 
and confidence in Dan Fournier and as I mentioned Dan's approach within 
Blakes becomes exclusive and results in inefficient allocation of Blakes 
resources to our files.  He tries to conquer the client and thereby alienates 
the talent within his firm.  I know for a fact, after he has squeezed others 
out on our work and his mismanagement of this issue with Enron, that if Dan 
is back in the saddle, many of his partners will not been keen on doing our 
work under Dan's terms.  I also know that there is a philosophy in Houston to 
commercial people not having say in legal retainers, but I believe that the 
senior commercial people who are responsible for the transactions, 
particularly in a smaller office in a smaller market, have an important place 
in the relationship, and in that regard, I know Fournier has lost the trust 
and confidence of Rob Milnthorp.

2.  Regarding Donahue Ernst and Young, it should be borne in mind that the 
initial contact to doing work at their firm was through Jordan Mintz and 
Morris Clark on the tax side.  I also know Jordan thinks well not just of 
their firm but of the multidisciplinary business model.  I also think that 
Jim needs to understand that the business model is likely not going away, and 
likely to expand in Canada, the US and Europe and is something we likely 
cannot ignore.  Also, the circumstances you will recall for us using DEY 
initially was on regulatory and contracting issues affecting the retail 
market, where the incumbent firms with any experience in the area were all 
conflicted and in an area where Blakes is particularly weak in Calgary.  (We 
first approached Stikemans, which had conflict with Enmax, and Bennett Jones, 
which had a conflict with ATCO.  Other firms which we do not typically use 
but which had experience also had conflicts.  After that, I solicited written 
propsals from both Blakes and DEY and interviewed with them with the retail 
team.)  Frankly, DEY has done good work for us.  E&Y is also very well 
situated on the market development side in Ontario, a leading proponent of 
deregulation of the Ontario market, and worked with us to set up our systems 
in Toronto for market opening.

3.  Should I e-mail to Jim a proposed agenda for our call on the 20th 
outlining the firms we currently use in different capacities in Canada?  
Blakes, Bennett Jones, Stikemans, Oslers, Donahue E&Y, or is a less structurd 
call anticipated?

Peter.

He said that threshold was met June 20, the day after an action by the=20

Maviglio said at the time. ""Their pricing has been far more reasonable than=

Maviglio acknowledged the stock ownership several days after the=20

Maviglio said that the ""open"" order he placed meant that he could not have=

Davis energy aide leaves -- without pay=20

Power delivery efficiency questioned: Output at low-cost generating plants=
=20
has been cut while costlier ones continue to operate.
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 31, 2001)=20
California is sometimes deliberately cutting output from low-cost power=20
plants while running more expensive ones, utility and grid officials say.=
=20
The sporadic episodes haven't cost much yet, but they illustrate a=20
potentially troubling disconnect in the system that has quickly grown betwe=
en=20
two agencies that help deliver electricity to a power-strapped state.=20
""We seem to be building this inefficiency into the system, and it doesn't=
=20
seem to be getting better,"" said Mike Florio, a consumer advocate who sits =
on=20
the governing board of the Independent System Operator.=20
The trouble is that the ISO, created in 1996 to manage the power grid in a=
=20
deregulated electric market, tries to run the grid by auctions that -- in=
=20
theory -- provide the cheapest electricity for the state's consumers.=20
Meanwhile, the state Department of Water Resources, which in January steppe=
d=20
in to buy power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities, isn't bidding at some=
=20
auctions because it believes it can provide cheaper power if it doesn't.=20
""We have an inefficient market and an inept government entity. It's sort of=
=20
the worst of both worlds,"" Florio said, criticizing his agency and the DWR.=
=20
ISO staffers decline to discuss the situation in detail, saying it involves=
=20
confidential bidding behavior.=20
But Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-buying arm of the=20
Department of Water Resources, confirmed that the ISO has been asking his=
=20
agency to take part in more auctions, but the state has declined.=20
The state's role is to buy electricity for customers of utilities whose=20
credit was no longer good enough to buy on their own, he said.=20
""We're not in it to do those kinds of marketing functions,"" he said. ""It's=
=20
not necessarily a good fit.""=20
Some of the ISO auctions are used to lessen congestion on transmission line=
s.=20
Others are used to stabilize the grid by slightly increasing or decreasing=
=20
output when demand doesn't match forecasts.=20
Generally, the highest-cost power plants should be the ones cutting back, a=
=20
process the industry calls ""decking.""=20
But since May, on ISO orders, Southern California Edison has repeatedly=20
throttled back on the Mohave Generating Station, which produces some of the=
=20
cheapest power available to California today, costing as little as $10 to $=
20=20
a megawatt-hour.=20
Edison, which owns a majority share of Mohave, has cut its output by 5,660=
=20
megawatt-hours between May and July, about one-half of 1 percent, at the=20
ISO's behest, according to data Edison provided to The Bee.=20
The ISO could probably have saved the state's consumers $370,000 at one pla=
nt=20
if it had asked a higher-cost gas-burning plant to cut back instead of=20
Mohave, a coal-burning workhorse in Laughlin, Nev., Florio said.=20
The amount sounds like ""small potatoes,"" but in some ways it is more alarmi=
ng=20
than the $14 million the state lost recently by selling excess power for le=
ss=20
than it paid, he said.=20
Industry experts agree that such below-cost sales are common in a business=
=20
where power needs fluctuate dramatically based on the weather.=20
By contrast, ""this is a dead weight loss. Higher costs are being incurred f=
or=20
no good reason,"" Florio said.=20
""The question is, why is the ISO calling on Mohave and not (cheaper) gas=20
plants? The answer is, the gas plants aren't bidding ... probably because=
=20
they're contracted with DWR,"" he said.=20
Four Corners, another low-cost coal plant partly owned by Edison, has also=
=20
been throttled back at ISO request, Edison officials said.=20
In addition, so few bidders have shown up at ISO auctions to ease stress on=
=20
transmission lines that the system has fallen into disarray, with the ISO=
=20
instead ordering across-the-board power production cuts that are boosting=
=20
costs, Florio said.=20
For its part, the ISO will say only that ""we are making the most economical=
=20
decisions we can based on the bids available,"" said spokeswoman Stephanie=
=20
McCorkle.=20
DWR's Garris said the state and the ISO have been meeting repeatedly on=20
bidding and other coordination issues, and he hopes to have a=20
smoother-running system in place by next summer.=20

Davis: FERC excluding $5 billion of owed refunds=20
By Jim Sanders
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 31, 2001)=20
A ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last week could cost=
=20
Californians $5 billion in energy refunds, according to Gov. Gray Davis, wh=
o=20
filed a formal request Monday for a rehearing in the case.=20
Although the commission's order suggested that California is owed refunds=
=20
because of exorbitant electricity prices during the recent energy crisis, t=
he=20
order's fine print placed severe limits on such refunds, Davis said.=20
""FERC is up to its old tricks again,"" he said. ""They talk about refunds for=
=20
California. But in this case, talk really is cheap: The details of its late=
st=20
order show it has no intention of making California whole.""=20
Tamara Young-Allen, a FERC spokeswoman, declined comment Monday and said th=
e=20
agency does not discuss pending cases.=20
California is seeking $8.9 billion in alleged overcharges for electricity=
=20
purchased from May 2000 to June 19, when FERC imposed new rules to prevent=
=20
price gouging.=20
On Wednesday, FERC ordered hearings to determine precisely how much money=
=20
electricity generators would have to pay in refunds to California.=20
At the time, Davis applauded FERC's ruling, saying it validates California'=
s=20
claim that ""significant refunds are due"" and that the agency's action ""gets=
=20
us closer to realizing that refund.""=20
But after poring over details of the 40-page order, state officials said=20
Monday that it excludes from consideration more than half the amount sought=
=20
by the state -- leaving $3.9 billion in dispute.=20
Attorney Barry Goode and Nancy McFadden, key members of Davis' energy team,=
=20
said the FERC order would not allow refunds:=20
For about $2 billion in alleged overcharges stemming from electricity=20
purchased by Californians between May and October of last year.=20
For electricity bought by the state Department of Water Resources from=20
private companies this year. The state says it is owed about $3 billion fro=
m=20
such purchases.=20
The FERC ruling means that only DWR's purchases through the state's=20
now-defunct Power Exchange or through the operator of a statewide electrici=
ty=20
transmission grid will be considered for refunds, officials said.=20
Such limitations by the regulatory agency are impractical because the marke=
t=20
was dysfunctional, leaving DWR with few options, when the state began buyin=
g=20
electricity for debt-strapped private utilities in January, Goode said.=20
""Now FERC says Californians are not entitled to refunds even though they=20
determined the prices were excessively high,"" Davis said. ""It's time for FE=
RC=20
to decide who they are working for: the greedy out-of-state generators or t=

The motion filed Monday sets the stage for a possible lawsuit.=20

Bill would streamline the path to local power: More cities, including Davis=

With the future of California's investor-owned utilities clouded by the=20
state's energy crisis, more and more cities, including Davis, are looking t=

Cities, public-power advocates and state Sen. Nell Soto, D-Pomona, are=20

create municipal utility districts.=20
""My solution to the power crisis is to reassert our interests and declare o=

companies,"" said Soto, who is carrying the bill, SB 23xx.=20
The Senate approved the bill earlier this month. The Assembly is expected t=

Given the cloudy financial future of Davis' power provider, Pacific Gas and=

""You get to choose the type of energy you want. ... I can't think of a bad=

=20
in the drive.=20
After Yolo County officials last year denied an effort to form a public pow=

authority in Davis, the city is ready to take a fresh look. The city, which=

public power activists said their plan would have put the basic formation=

Public power boosters said lobbying by PG&E doomed their plans.=20
SB 23xx also simplifies the approval process, allowing a simple majority of=

Seizing transformers, power lines and other utility company infrastructure=

municipal utility districts under the bill. A utility company would not be=

those gains have no bearing on the $750 million debt the utility claims to =

The company's effort to seal a deal with the state to clear the $750 millio=
n=20
debt has come under attack by the Utility Consumers' Action Network. The Sa=
n=20
Diego-based consumer group says SDG&E's claimed debt is the result of=20
selective bookkeeping, bordering on fraud.  The bottom line, says UCAN, is=
=20
that SDG&E engaged in deception and probably owes its customers money. =20
SDG&E, which claimed to have sold customers electricity without markups,=20
actually ""was buying electricity at a low price and selling it at a higher=

over the past year about this balancing account.""  UCAN says that SDG&E=20
earned an estimated $450 million from its power sales to the state, while=
=20
publicly declaring that it was posting only losses from buying power.  Sham=

said much of the information leading to UCAN's conclusion came from a=20
detailed analysis of documents made available in recent weeks.  The state=
=20
Office of Ratepayer Advocates, meanwhile, yesterday said a new filing by=20
SDG&E that claims its power-sales profits belong to stockholders, not=20
consumers, is ""specious"" and ""without merit.""  Van Herik insisted the compa=
ny=20
had not been misleading. The spokesman noted that the company earlier was=
=20
required to buy electricity from the Power Exchange, a now-defunct=20
marketplace established by the state as part of its deregulation plan.  ""Wh=
at=20
we said is that we were buying electricity for our customers and passing=20
along the cost without markup,"" said Van Herik.  What SDG&E failed to=20
publicly announce was that it was simultaneously selling electricity to the=
=20
Power Exchange for an apparently healthy profit.  Under certain contracts,=
=20
SDG&E had locked in electricity at prices substantially below going rates=
=20
during the ongoing power crisis. The company declined yesterday to reveal=
=20
terms of the contracts. But UCAN estimates the contracts provided electrici=
ty=20
to the utility at no more than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour.  SDG&E then sold=
=20
that relatively cheap power to the Power Exchange for a higher price and=20
pocketed the profit, which it also declined to disclose.  As it profited fr=
om=20
the power sales, SDG&E bought power at higher prices from the exchange and=
=20
billed customers for what it paid.  Whenever SDG&E's costs to buy electrici=
ty=20
exceeded what state regulators would allow the utility to charge customers,=
=20
it recorded the amounts in balancing accounts. That account grew to $750=20
million.  But SDG&E never offset its losses from electricity purchases with=
=20
its profit from sales.  Van Herik said the practice was appropriate because=
=20
the lucrative contracts for cheap power were owned by the company's=20
shareholders, not its customers. The practice of keeping profits and losses=
=20
entirely separate, he said, was endorsed by a California Public Utilities=
=20
Commission audit.  But the first formal ruling on that matter came in June,=
=20
when the full commission ruled that all profits from SDG&E's contractual=20
power deals belong to its customers.  SDG&E went to court to overturn the=

award the company's shareholders ownership of the profits SDG&E made from=

because it recognized that SDG&E had a strong legal case.  But Shames says=

the state had a strong case and noted that the Office of Ratepayer Advocate=

THE STATE
Davis' Energy Advisors Draw SEC Attention
Probe: Under review is the possible use of inside information to buy power=
=20
company stocks. GOP rival of governor requested the inquiry.
By WALTER HAMILTON JEFFERY L. RABIN and DARYL KELLEY
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

July 31 2001

The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry=
=20
into whether energy consultants advising Gov. Gray Davis used inside=20
information to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the stat=
e,=20
a source with knowledge of the matter said Monday.

The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in=20
response to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones. A=20
Republican rival of Davis, Jones charged that stock trading by consultants=
=20
may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based on=20
information not available to the public.

On Friday, top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had be=
en=20
fired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions a=
nd=20
their personal finances. As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the=20
capital Monday, Davis officials were confronted by a flurry of questions=20
about who in the administration owns energy stocks.

Financial disclosure records filed by the governor's spokesman, Steve=20
Maviglio, show that he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas company=
=20
he and his boss have accused of making ""obscene"" profits while California h=
as=20
been ""on its knees."" Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houston-based=20
Enron Corp. in 1996.

""It's not a crime to own energy stock,"" Maviglio said.

He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which has the=20
largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts.

Maviglio placed the order for the stock on May 31, one day after San Jose's=
=20
mayor dropped his opposition to a controversial Calpine plant favored by th=
e=20
governor and others. Under the terms of Maviglio's purchase, the transactio=
n=20
was completed about three weeks later when the stock reached $40 a share, a=
=20
value of $12,000. It has since fallen in value.

""I viewed it as a good long-term investment,"" Maviglio said, adding that he=
=20
purchased the shares for his retirement account based on publicly available=
=20
information.

The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms=
=20
that it has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But=20
California's grid operator has identified the company as one of many energy=
=20
merchants to overcharge the state millions of dollars.

The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from=
=20
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show.

Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs secretary Barry=20
Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that he recently held=
=20
between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state company accused of=
=20
multimillion-dollar price gouging.

In a statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month afte=
r=20
he began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares were=
=20
supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll, but his broker=20
failed to do so.

In light of the recent disclosures, Secretary of State Jones said the=20
governor must do more to ensure the public that its interest comes first.

""The governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated=20
conflict of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any=20
activity since their last statement of economic interest was filed,"" said=
=20
Jones, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor.

Word of the SEC's entry into California's energy problems comes as the=20
governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for the quick and=
=20
broad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him through the=20
crisis.

In his written request to the SEC, Jones said that recently filed disclosur=
e=20
documents showed that at least one consultant bought and sold shares of two=
=20
energy companies within the same month, raising ""a red flag"" about the=20
possibility of insider trading.

State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving the=
ir=20
personal financial interests.

The five consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter,=
=20
delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was not=
=20
clear which individuals are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether the=
=20
agency's review would result in any charges.

Two of the former traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by=
=20
federal investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider=
=20
trading.

But William Mead, fired Thursday, said it is no mystery why so many of his=
=20
colleagues owned Calpine stock.

Mead said he bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommende=
d=20
it to his colleagues last year, while they all still worked for the=20
now-defunct California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was not=20
traded on that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said.

Mead and three other energy traders--hired by the state in February and=20
March--were terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying pow=
er=20
for the state from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired traders=
=20
Herman Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of=20
their Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to =
be=20
filed only two weeks ago.

""But I'm sure they bought it while they were still at the power exchange,=
=20
because that's when we discussed it,"" Mead said. ""It was kind of like a=20
hobby. I'm sure it wasn't done with the intent to manipulate.""

Former trader Elaine Griffin, who also owned Calpine stock and resigned two=
=20
weeks ago to take another job, said she didn't know she owned energy=20
securities until she checked with her financial advisor July 13, just befor=
e=20
leaving her state job.

Griffin said she and her husband own about $10,000 worth of Calpine stock i=
n=20
individual retirement accounts managed by their advisor, who bought the sto=
ck=20
Feb. 1 without their knowledge, she said, after research found it to be a=
=20
good investment.

""I kind of feel like we've been used for political reasons,"" Griffin said.=
=20
""We would have disclosed anything right at first, but they never asked.""

As a trader, Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for the=20
state, but only at market prices.

Meanwhile, two Democratic political consultants, who helped Davis polish hi=
s=20
image after the ongoing energy crisis caused his poll numbers to plummet,=
=20
have agreed to accept no payment for their work as part of an out-of-court=
=20
settlement of a taxpayer lawsuit.

Tom Hiltachk, a lawyer for conservative anti-tax activist Lewis Uhler, said=
=20
the settlement was reached last Friday after negotiations with lawyers for=
=20
communications consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane.

""Now they will not receive one red cent,"" said Hiltachk. ""Very simply Mr.=
=20
Fabiani and Mr. Lehane have agreed to cease all activities for the governor=
,=20
to accept no payments for their services and to basically get out of the=20
consulting business with the governor.""

As his part of the agreement, Hiltachk said, Uhler withdrew his lawsuit=20
Monday morning.

Uhler had filed a lawsuit against the two consultants and Controller Kathle=
en=20
Connell in June contending that they should not receive any payments becaus=
e=20
of a conflict of interest. The two men also did consulting work for=20
financially troubled Southern California Edison, which was seeking help fro=
m=20
Davis and the Legislature.

Connell, a former Los Angeles mayoral candidate who has been at odds with=
=20
Davis since he endorsed an opponent, had held up the payments pending the=
=20
outcome of the lawsuit.

Under an agreement with Davis, the men were to have been paid $30,000 a mon=
th=20
for six months.

Fabiani and Lehane could not be reached for comment.

GOV. GRAY DAVIS seems to have an ethical blind spot when it comes to the=20
hiring of outsiders to help manage California's energy crisis.=20
Throughout the crisis, Davis has been intolerably slow in responding to=20
questions about whether certain members of his inner circle -- drawing big=
=20
checks off the public payroll -- might have possible financial conflicts.=
=20
As of yesterday, the governor's office still has not required 16 contractor=
s=20
to file public disclosure documents that would reveal whether they have any=
=20
financial stake in companies affected by policies they help develop.=20
Steve Maviglio, the governor's press secretary, said 42 energy ""consultants=
""=20
have filed their economic disclosure statements. But he said the other 16=
=20
were ""contractors"" -- without actual decisionmaking authority -- and were=
=20
thus not required to fill out the forms.=20
Maviglio's ""contractor versus consultant"" distinctions are technical and=20
semantic. His spin simply doesn't wash.=20
The bottom line is that ""contractors"" who are making big decisions involvin=
g=20
big dollars for the state are not playing by the same rules as others in th=
e=20
public trust.=20
For example, Davis has exempted two Wall Street executives, Joseph Fichera=
=20
and Michael Hoffman, who are putting together a rescue plan that involves a=
=20
$12.5 billion bond issue. They are getting $275,000 a month for their advic=
e.=20
Yet they have not been required to fill out disclosure forms, which would=
=20
allow the governor -- and any other Californian -- to assess whether a=20
potential conflict exists.=20
""They told us they don't have any conflicts,"" said Maviglio, who,=20
incidentally, confirmed yesterday that in June he bought $12,000 worth of=
=20
stock in the Calpine Corp., the generating company with the largest chunk o=
f=20
state power contracts. On July 2, Davis publicly praised Calpine as ""the mo=
st=20
responsible of the generators.""=20
Davis should have finally learned his lesson last week after having to fire=
=20
five consultants -- all involved in energy trading -- when their belatedly=
=20
filed disclosure forms showed serious potential conflicts. A sixth consulta=
nt=20
quit. Four of those traders owned Calpine shares.=20
A week earlier, the Davis administration was forced to order a group of=20
consultants to hastily unload their power-company holdings or lose their=20
contracts.=20
The governor's office also has been stung by revelations that political=20
consultants Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, hired at $30,000 a month to=20
develop energy-related ""communications strategies,"" also had a contract wit=
h=20
Southern California Edison.=20
Moreover, some of the disclosure forms that have been filed to date have be=
en=20
less than complete, especially regarding the timing of the buying and selli=

of energy stocks.=20

San Francisco -- After decades of trying to persuade San Francisco to take=
=20
control of its electrical system, advocates of public power now have the=20
issue before city voters.=20
""The timing couldn't be better,"" said consumer advocate Medea Benjamin, co-=
=20
director of San Francisco's Global Exchange.=20
""It's not just the threat of blackouts or the highest rate hikes in history=
.=20
It's the fact that PG&E is in bankruptcy. It's the depletion of the state=
=20
budget,"" she said. ""This is a hell of an opportunity.""=20
The opportunity she is talking about centers on two November ballot measure=
s=20
that would pave the way for creating a public power system and taking Pacif=
ic=20
Gas and Electric Co. out of the city's electricity market.=20
Under the proposed measures, an elected board of directors would set the=20
rates and have control over everything from the terms for buying electricit=
y=20
to whether to use more renewable energy sources, such as wind, hydroelectri=
c=20
and solar power.=20
Public power would base policies ""on a more localized basis, where the valu=
es=20
of an individual community can be put into practice,"" said Ed Smeloff, a=20
longtime public power advocate who was recently hired as an assistant gener=
al=20
manager at the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission.=20
One proposal, an initiative placed on the ballot by residents, calls for=20
setting up a municipal utility district in San Francisco and neighboring=20
Brisbane. The district would be governed by an elected board of directors.=
=20
The other measure, placed on the ballot last week by the Board of=20
Supervisors, would create a municipal water and power agency and would affe=
ct=20
only San Francisco.=20
PG&E has mounted a campaign to defeat the measures, so far pumping more tha=
n=20
$200,000 into the effort.=20
""We think the (ballot proposals) are a bad idea,"" said Frank Gallagher,=20
spokesman for the Coalition for Affordable Public Services, the PG&E-financ=
ed=20
group fighting the measures. ""They're confusing and do nothing to address t=
he=20
problem.""=20
The company has a history of opposing public power proposals, derailing a=
=20
plan in Davis in the 1990s and using a legal challenge to stall the start o=
f=20
Sacramento's Municipal Utility District for two decades.=20
For years, private utilities have enjoyed a powerful hold on state and loca=
l=20
politicians. But the energy crisis has caused widespread public anger and=
=20
concern, forcing city and state officials to take another look at public=20
power.=20
A poll conducted this month by the Public Policy Institute of California, a=
=20
nonpartisan think tank in San Francisco, found that nearly two-thirds of=20
Californians support the replacement of private electric companies with=20
municipal power authorities formed by local governments.=20
San Francisco already owns a power system, Hetch Hetchy, which provides pow=
er=20
for city departments. PG&E provides power to residents and businesses.=20
The San Francisco Charter amendment placed on the ballot by the supervisors=
=20
calls for abolishing the city's existing Public Utilities Commission, which=
=20
is run by commissioners and a director appointed by the mayor. The proposed=
=20
public power board would have seven elected directors, but the agency still=
=20
would retain some ties to City Hall.=20
The supervisors' plan is intended to be used as a backup to the municipal=
=20
utility district -- commonly known as a MUD -- which is considered to be mo=
re=20
vulnerable to the expected legal challenges from PG&E.=20
""It's a great marriage, and will ensure that we get public power in San=20
Francisco,"" said Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano, chief sponsor =
of=20
the board's measure.=20
San Francisco is not alone in looking at public power. San Diego, the first=
=20
city to feel the hard pinch of the energy crisis, wants to establish a=20
regional public power system in an attempt to pool resources and bring down=
=20
energy costs.=20
The East Bay Municipal Utility District, which provides water and sewer=20
service, is considering expanding its reach to power. In the Bay Area, the=
=20
cities of Alameda and Palo Alto already have public power. The two largest=
=20
public power agencies in the state serve Los Angeles and Sacramento.=20
In San Francisco, the pro-public power forces are going to tout the promise=
d=20
virtues of turning the electric utility over to a public authority that by=
=20
law cannot turn a profit. That, they contend, means lower rates.=20
""It's an expectation, but it's also tried and true,"" said Ross Mirkarimi,=
=20
campaign director of MUD Now, the group sponsoring the ballot initiative.=
=20
On average, consumers pay 18 percent less for power from public utilities, =
he=20
said.=20
Gallagher, spokesman for the opposition campaign, said ratepayers shouldn't=
=20
assume that public power means lower energy bills. ""There's no way the rate=
s=20
are going down,"" he said.=20
He blamed the energy crisis not on deregulation but on a shortage of=20
electricity, which jacked up prices and undercut reliability.=20

California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electrici=

LANCE T. IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the Sa=
n=20
Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute.
On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis wit=
h=20
regard to California's electricity crisis. The governor has scored some nic=
e=20
publicity by switching on some new power plants. The weather has been=20
unseasonably cool. His poll numbers are edging back up. Yet beneath this=20
optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument th=
at=20
out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis ha=
s=20
been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private=20
generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that th=
is=20
amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation betwee=
n=20
state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's=
=20
chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a hug=
e=20
overcharge ""has not and cannot be substantiated."" Further, while the=20
generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state,=20
perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the=
=20
state than they owe the state in refunds: ""Can a cash refund be required=20
where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not.""=
=20
Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a ""raw deal"" and by urgin=
g=20
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and=
=20
the judge's conclusions and to ""step up and provide the refunds we've asked=
=20
for."" Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed,=
=20
Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a=20
""melodramatic virtual world"" de-linked from reality.=20
Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly=20
released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power=20
companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the=20
average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year.=
=20
California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles=
=20
Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District=
=20
(SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state=
=20
generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping=
=20
boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $33=
0=20
per megawatt hour.=20
Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis=20
spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at ""the generators=
=20
who wear cowboy hats"" and that ""just because there are other entities that=
=20
are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off=
=20
by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte.""=20
Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, i=
t=20
turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business=20
consumers are ripped off by state government. Davis has signed $43 billion =
in=20
ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price. The=
=20
state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the=
=20
current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state=
=20
power purchases. This is especially important to Davis since the high price=
s=20
are borne disproportionately by business. Thus, Davis' regulators are set t=

SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- For the past seven months, Gov. Gray Davis has begged=

cajoled and even threatened legislators and regulators, to lay the groundwo=
rk=20
for a $12.5 billion bond issue California needs to cover the cost of keepin=

Now comes the tough part: persuading investors that the bond is an attracti=
ve=20
investment. On that score, Mr. Davis's team, whose credibility has been=20
battered by California's months-long electricity crisis, is hoping to bounc=
e=20
back from a rocky start.=20
This week, a delegation headed by state Treasurer Philip Angelides is=20
scheduled to visit Wall Street to pitch the municipal debt offering, which=
=20
would be the largest in U.S. history by a factor of nearly four. To succeed=
,=20
Mr. Angelides will have to allay investors' fears of the kind of political=
=20
infighting that already has delayed the issue several times. He will have t=
o=20
satisfy bond-rating agencies that the bond is safe enough to merit a top-ti=
er=20
investment-grade rating. And he'll have to make investors want to buy it=20
without demanding costly inducements that would give California financial=
=20
headaches for decades to come.=20
""This isn't building the Panama Canal. It's not Apollo 11,"" says Mr.=20
Angelides. But, he concedes, the bond sale will be ""uniquely challenging.""=
=20
That is because this giant bond issue won't be backed by the full faith and=
=20
credit of the state or by tax dollars -- the types of guarantees public-deb=
t=20
investors often prefer. Instead, the bonds, which will have maturities of a=
s=20
long as 15 years, are to be paid off by the state's electricity ratepayers=
=20
from their monthly bills, which some view as a riskier source of cash flow.=
=20
Moreover, there is still a question as to whether the issue's proceeds will=
=20
be adequate to repay the bonds, restore the state's financially troubled=20
private utilities to health and finance future electricity purchases.=20
Despite these hurdles, many analysts predict California will eventually=20
succeed in pulling off the bond deal, though at a cost far higher than=20
originally anticipated. In fact, the apparent easing of the state's energy=
=20
crunch may make its marketing job a bit less difficult. A recent drop in th=

Still, the specter of history overhangs the bond offering. Rating agencies=

and the 1994 bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif. Moreover, Moody's Investor=

California's need for the bonds -- like most of the state's energy woes --=
=20
stems from its troubled 1996 electricity-deregulation plan. Under the plan,=
=20
the state's investor-owned utilities were obliged to sell many of their pow=
er=20
plants to other companies and purchase electricity through a state-sponsore=
d=20
power auction. Consumer rates were frozen, but wholesale rates weren't.=20
The system worked fairly well until May 2000, when wholesale rates began=20
soaring amid tight electricity supplies and stronger-than-expected demand.=
=20
Last year, the state's cost of wholesale power climbed to $27 billion from =
$7=20
billion in 1999. In the first six months of this year, that sum hit $20=20
billion.=20
With retail rates frozen, Pacific Gas & Electric, a unit of PG&E Corp., and=
=20
Edison International's Southern California Edison racked up billions of=20
dollars of debts. In January, after power generators stopped doing business=
=20
with the utilities, the state began buying power on their behalf. It borrow=
ed=20
the money from its general fund, normally used to pay for everything from=
=20
public safety and environmental programs to social services and education, =
at=20
a pace of more than $1 billion a month.=20
In February, Mr. Davis's allies in the state Legislature helped him pass a=
=20
bill authorizing the state to sell bonds to replenish the fund and to=20
continue making power purchases. But legislators cautiously capped the size=
=20
of the borrowing, using a complex formula. Under the new law, the formula=
=20
would allow only for a bond sale of less than $1 billion.=20
Realizing that wasn't sufficient, the governor and the assembly drafted=20
another bill that scrapped the formula and allowed the state to sell up to=
=20
$13.4 billion of bonds. But, in a setback for Mr. Davis, Republican lawmake=
rs=20
banded together to deny him the two-thirds majority needed for the bill to=
=20
immediately become law. As a result, the law won't take effect until=20
mid-August, when the public-finance market is all but moribund.=20
In the meantime, Mr. Angelides moved to hire underwriters. After receiving=
=20
four dozen bids from Wall Street investment bankers in February, he retaine=
d=20
a team led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. But under pressure to get the financi=
ng=20
moving, the treasurer didn't negotiate firm underwriting fees on the deal.=
=20
At the time, Mr. Angelides said he expected the underwriters to ""skinny dow=

their fees given the enormous size of the offering. But Morgan, representin=
g=20
a team of underwriters that includes Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Citgrou=
p=20
Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit and Bear, Stearns & Co., says it expects t=
o=20
charge standard fees, given the significant challenges presented by the=20
issue's size. In the case of a $12.5 billion sale, that amounts to around $=
56=20
million. J.P. Morgan and the California treasurer's office now say the fees=
=20
won't be decided until they determine the bond issue's final size and=20
structure.=20
From the start, relations between California officials and Wall Street seem=
ed=20
fraught with miscommunication. In February, Mr. Davis called a meeting to=
=20
explain to institutional investors, analysts and rating-agency executives h=
is=20
blueprint for getting a grip on California's energy crisis. The session, hi=
s=20
only face-to-face meeting with investors to date, was held at Manhattan's=
=20
Cornell Club. Attendees say the governor kept them waiting for 20 minutes=
=20
before breezing into the room and giving them only a general overview of th=
e=20
state's energy plan, which left investors grumbling.=20
During the discussion, Mr. Davis, a Bronx, N.Y., native, made light of a=20
conversation he had had with Richard Cortright Jr., a Standard & Poor's=20
director. ""I told him: `You're from Indiana, that explains why you're not=

=20
recall the exchange; Mr. Davis is frequently late for public engagements. A=
=20

Then, in March, the governor's office set up a conference call to update=20
investors. Figuring they wouldn't get a big turnout, they used an open-mike=

Critical barriers remain. The state's Public Utilities Commission has yet t=

The five-to-20-year power contracts signed in a panic by the Davis=20

Last summer, under a flawed deregulation, a handful of large out-of-state=

=20
This ""sellers cartel"" first drained our electric utilities dry. In November=

budget surplus. This required the state Public Utilities Commission to pass=
=20
the largest rate hike in California history and will require the state to=
=20
issue $12.4 billion in bonds this fall to service this debt.=20
In February, with spot market prices at all-time highs and rolling blackout=
s=20
rippling through the state, the governor's representatives began to negotia=
te=20
long-term contracts with the sellers cartel. This was an ill-advised=20
long-term strategy to fight a short-run crisis. To understand why, look at=
=20
the negotiating chessboard from the electricity cartel's perspective. The=
=20
cartel's negotiators knew that within 18 to 24 months, there would be a hug=
e=20
glut of power on the market as many power plants were already under=20
construction in California and throughout the West. Once the new energy=20
resources were available, the cartel would no longer be able to manipulate=
=20
the market. This supply glut would drive prices back to the 1999 range of=
=20
three to five cents per kilowatt-hour, far lower than the prices now set in=
=20
the long-term energy contracts.=20
To the cartel members, this looming power glut was a recipe for heavy losse=

Locking the state into long-term contracts at lucrative rates was their=20
redemption. The Davis administration walked into this market inferno,=20
bargaining from extreme weakness at the top of the market, signing contract=
s=20
that were too expensive. The administration also capitulated on two highly=

generators ""harmless"" for any increase in taxes imposed on the generators b=

the state. This provision essentially freezes taxes on the generators over=
=20
the next several years, requiring taxpayers to pick up the tab.=20
Notwithstanding the administration's spin, the current improvement in our=

has been unusually cool, Californians have increased their conservation,=20
recessionary forces have reduced demand and, most important, the Federal=20

Electrical Switch: Now, Cheaper Power
Is Causing Hefty Losses for California=20
By Rebecca Smith

07/31/2001=20
The Wall Street Journal=20

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)=20
Mild weather means that California is escaping blackouts, but it also means=
=20
that the state is amassing power-trading losses that are adding to the cost=
=20
of an energy mess now in its 15th month.=20
Internal documents show that so far in July, California has resold the=20
equivalent of 8% of the power it bought under short-term and long-term=20
contracts that were designed to reduce the state's reliance on the volatile=
=20
and costly spot market. The problem is, the state has had a surfeit of powe=
r,=20
and it has been selling the juice into the market at a fraction of the pric=
e=20
it paid, leading to losses from July 1 through Thursday of about $30 millio=
n=20
to $35 million.=20
The losses illustrate the difficulties dogging the state's new energy czar,=
=20
the California Department of Water Resources, despite a softening of=20
electricity prices and demand. The department got into the power-purchasing=
=20
business in a big way in January, when the state's biggest investor-owned=
=20
utilities quit buying power because they were no longer creditworthy. Since=
=20
then, the state has signed $43 billion worth of contracts, one for as much =
as=20
20 years, in a bid to tamp down high spot-market prices. Critics now say it=
=20
was a mistake to lock in so much power at such a high cost.=20
Power officials say the state has been in the odd position since last month=
=20
of having too much power contracted for off-peak hours. ""It's something you=
'd=20
expect when you first get into a new business and you'd hope to reduce it,""=
=20
said Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-purchasing agency.=20
Internal numbers from the DWR, which the agency has confirmed, show that on=
=20
average the state paid, from July 1 to Thursday, $123 per megawatt hour for=
=20
some 1.8 million megawatts of power purchased under long-term contracts, an=
d=20
$148 per megawatt hour for some 2.2 million megawatt hours of power purchas=
ed=20
under short-term contracts. In the same period, the records show it sold=20
excess power amounting to 320,000 megawatt hours at an average price of $27=
=20
per megawatt hour, less than what it costs to fuel many plants. At times, t=
he=20
DWR sold the juice for as little as $2 per megawatt hour.=20
This, ironically, has offered an opportunity to power traders that the stat=
e=20
was seeking to hem in through its contract program. They have been able at=
=20
times to substitute cheap power they buy from the state for the more costly=
=20
power they otherwise would have to generate to meet their contract=20
obligations.=20
Despite the agency's power-trading losses, total market costs still are dow=
n=20
substantially from previous months, partly due to price limits set June 19 =
by=20
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Slacker demand also has been a=20
factor. In June, Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International=
,=20
sold 11.8% less electricity to its customers than in June 2000, reflecting=
=20
energy conservation and reduced demand for air conditioning.=20
Since January the state has spent $9.5 billion buying power at an average=

cost of $237 per megawatt hour, according to internal DWR documents. That i=

more than double the price of wholesale electricity last year, when prices=

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

With respect to the Northwestern transaction, I'd like to understand what it 
would take in the letter agreement to allow us to recognize the entire $8MM 
upon execution of the letter agreement. In my conversation today with Kay, we 
talked about making sure we could at least recognize the $8MM in equal 
instalments between the execution of the letter agreement and September 1, 
2001 (the outside date for closing). If at all possible, I'd like to take 
this one step further so that the entire amount could be recognized in Q2. 
Let's plan to talk about this on Monday. Any thoughts on this prior to Monday 
would be appreciated.

Rick Richard sent an Email to you of 1/5/0l recommending support of Daryl 
Owen and Don Santa for positions with the Department of Energy.   Steve Kean 
asked that we give you background on these candidates, and Joe Hartsoe and 
Cynthia Sandherr significantly contributed to this response.  In sum, Don 
Santa is an excellent candidate for the DOE and has a well established record 
supporting competition in the gas and electric industries.  Daryl Owen, while 
a strong candidate, has a less established record on competition.  

Daryl Owen, Principal at Hooper Owen and Winburn seeks the position of Deputy 
Secretary at DOE.  He is a Democrat from Louisiana who is a family friend of 
Rick Richard's.  He formerly served as an Energy Legislative Assistant and 
Administrative Assistant to Senator J. Bennett Johnston (D-LA) from 1981-86; 
and Staff Director, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources from 
1986-1990.  He has been with first Hooper, Hooper and Owen and now Hoper Owen 
and Winburn since he left the Hill.  His partner, Lindsay Hooper, was former 
Tax Legislative Assistant and Legislative Director to Senator Malcolm Wallop 
(R-WY), 1980-1984.  Other partners include former Congressman Charlie Wilson 
(D-TX).

Daryl's current clients include Duke Energy, Entergy Corp., Entergy Services, 
Inc., Japan Nuclear Cycle Development Institute, TECO Energy, United Pan 
Europe and Waste Control Specialists, Inc..  The firm's energy clients 
include Coastal Corp and the ANR Pipeline.

One potential confirmation concern could track the problem his former 
partner, Nancy Dorn, encountered after Speaker Hastert  announced his intent 
to hire her to work for him.  Specifically, there was negative Washington 
Post front page press coverage concerning the work the firm does for the 
Embassy of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Coastal, and the Government of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan.  Specifically, Pakistan is an issue due to its 
nuclear proliferation.  Further, you may recall, other former Coastal 
employees had difficulties clearing the confirmation process in the Clinton 
Administration due to the company's Libya Sanctions violations.

On the political side, Secretary Designate Abraham has quietly told his 
former chief of staff that he needs a Deputy strong on nuclear defense 
issues.  Further, unless the Bush-Cheney team tells him differently, he would 
prefer to not have a Democrat in the Deputy slot.  Spence Abraham is meeting 
with the Bush-Cheney folks on Thursday, January 11th to discuss who has 
selection rights.  Until then, no decisions will be forthcoming.

Daryl knows much about the oil and gas industry.  As expected, he had strong 
ties to the producer community as a Capitol Hill staffer.  However, he has 
not been particularly active in the electricity restructuring debate on 
behalf of his clients.

Donald (Don) F. Santa, Jr., Senior Vice President for Strategic Planning for 
LG&E Corp. (1997-2001) seeks the position of FERC Chairman or a senior 
position at DOE.  He formerly served as Senior Vice President, Deputy General 
Counsel at LG&E Energy where he managed its public policy group and the legal 
matters for its energy marketing business.  Prior to that, he served four 
years as a  FERC Commissioner (1993-1997) with and  appointment as an 
Independent.  During his tenure, the Commissioner adopted several 
pro-competition Orders, including Nos. 636 and 888.  He also formerly served 
as Counsel  to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee (1989-1993) 
for Senator J. Bennett Johnston (D-LA).  Prior to that, Don was an associate 
attorney with Van Ness, Feldman, Sutcliffe & Curtis (1985-1989.)

Don served as the Chairman of the Electric Power Supply Association's 
(EPSA's) Regulatory Affairs Committee where he strongly advocated the same 
positions as Enron on electric industry restructuring issues.  It is rumored 
that Texas PUC Chairman Pat Wood now wants FERC Chair since Colin Powell's 
son appears a certainty for FCC Chairman.  If this is the case, Don would be 
an excellent DOE candidate.

Finally, although Spence Abraham is expected to be confirmed after his 
hearing on January 18th, Democrats on the Committee intend to speak against 
him for his prior support of legislation to close the Department of Energy.  
As such, his confirmation is not a ""sure thing.""  

Don would likely not be present the Transition Team with vetting 
irregularities and poses no apparent confirmation concerns.  Cynthia has 
heard from some close to him that he might not be interested in an 
Administration job because it requires a major salary reduction.  Don is a 
native of Connecticut who received his J.D. from Columbia University School 
of Law and his B.A. from Duke University.

Ken,

I feel terrible in writing this email to inform you that I am leaving Enron.
The timing of my departure is purely coincidental to the timing of the recent
events.

It has been a special and rewarding privilege to work at Enron over the past
three and a half years.  The integrity and high purpose you stand for is a
personal inspiration to me.  Seeing your leadership first-hand has been a
real treat.

Receiving the Chairman's Award last year was an incredible honor.  It is
difficult for me to feel truly deserving of it because of the sheer numbers
of amazingly dedicated, yet unrecognized heroes I have met at Enron.  I have
the greatest admiration of them and draw my inspiration from them.

One regret in leaving is that there will be those at Enron who will use my
departure as more negative fodder to taint the company image.  I wouldn't
ever wish that on you, especially in light of the recent challenges you are
experiencing.  So I apologize if that does come to pass.

One factor in my departure has been my disappointment with personnel abuses
I've observed with EES' origination management.  There is a general feeling 
of despair because the management chain looks the other way and the concept 
of an ""open door"" is political suicide.  H.R. is as much at fault in my 
opinion because they side with management as opposed to taking an objective 
view and judgement of the abuses.  My words and credibility may not carry 
any weight as I too have been victimized by the character assassination 
that is all too common at EES.

Though my emotions run high when I think about the injustices to good employees 
(and lost potential benefit to Enron), I leave with no bad feelings toward the company
and am proud to have been a part of Enron.

The shift in EES' business model had resulted in my taking on a new role this
past spring.  Being based outside of Houston (in the Chicago area), my career
opportunities are limited.  And as much as I tried, I was feeling stale and
unfulfilled in this new role and decided that it would be better for me to
move on.

Ken, I believe in you and wish you success and redemption through this difficult 
time.  I wish that I could have done more.  

If I can ever help, I hope that you won't hesitate to ask.  Thank you again.

Respectfully,

mark

I spoke to Peter Keohane while you were gone about that Canadian interest 
change question we asked him.  You'll see, he sent us both a fax with 
proposed changes to that section.

When you have a minute, let's chat about what Peter told me.  It wasn't a 
clear answer of what to do, so we need to decide which way we want to go on 
this."

Subject: MEH Quarter Success

Hat's off to the group for a very successful quarter for MEH.  I graciously 
commend everyone for the teamwork and perseverance displayed in tackling the 
array of transactions and tasks to ensure the successful start of our new 
joint business.  We continue to have many challenges ahead, but I wanted to 
take pause and in particular commend the following:

Trunkline Transaction Team - Roy Rodriguez, Russell Murrell, and Steve Curlee 
brought to closure a significant transaction with leveraged off many groups 
in the PEC and Enron organizations.  Net transaction mark to market on behalf 
of MEH was $2,286,634  with accrual and option values to be realized over the 
3 year term of the arrangement.  Team work permeated this transaction and 
thanks are due to 1) legal teams for PEC led by Mary Klyasheff and for ENA 
led by Sheila Tweed and Jeff Hodge 2) structuring group support from Steve 
Curlee,  Deirdre McCaffrey and Ed McMichael 3) Tony Compton for the 
successful closure of gas supply transactions with third parties 4) to all 
else who covered the many transaction closing issues and bookings. 
NSS and NGPL Capacity Transaction Team - Steve Richman, Roy Rodriguez, 
Richard Tomaski, Barbara Dillard and Lee Fascetti successfully proposed, 
negotiated and are now managing a 3 year storage and capacity management of 
approximately 18 BCF/year of NGPL no-notice storage and accompanying 
transportation with realized value year to date for MEH of $1,510,459  with 
an additional $1,541,835  of value to PGL ratepayers.  This transaction will 
continue to be a significant asset to leverage into the intra-day market  and 
our initial platform for on-line business (EOL).
Daily Optimization - Richard Tomaski, Barbara Dillard, Steve Richman, Tim 
Hermann, Cary Carrabine and Lee Fascetti , diligently pursued and completed 
other significant transactions for MEH totalling $1,252,584 for this 
quarter.  Richard Tomaski and Kevin Radous have spent endless amounts of time 
(and evenings/weekends) to ensure that MEH had a P&L to represent for the 
groups hard work and my many thanks extend to both.
Business Set-up - Tim Hermann, Roy Rodriguez, Paul Burgener, Gregg Penman, 
Kevin Radous, Richard Tomaksi, and Barbara Dillard have toiled diligently and 
continue to proceed in contracts/policy and procedures between PEC/ENA/PGL 
and third parties. Additional thanks are due to all groups within accounting, 
economics, and trading within PEC and ENA in support of this new business and 
we ask for your continued engagement.

Over the next month, we must get closure on the remaining requirements of 
running a tightly managed and successful business venture.  We must continue 
to take our ideas and strategies to financially successful commercial 
operation .  Momentum is now on our side...

Thanx,

Laura

DJ Greenspan Cites Concern About Electric Sector Investment
Dow Jones International News Service -- July 20, 2000  [Return to Headlines]


WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told
Congress Thursday he is concerned that disincentives for investment in the
electricity sector will destabilize the overall U.S. economy.

""The propensity to build new electric power facilities is being
disincentivized,"" Greenspan said.

""I'm worried about the instability that that creates within the economy and
the difficulties that might emerge as a consequence of that,"" the Fed
chairman said in response to a query by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.

""It is an issue we need to address,"" Greenspan said.

U.S. utilities have failed to make needed investments in generation plants
and transmission lines over the last decade in the face of regulatory
uncertainty posed by state and federal deregulation efforts.

Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has been touring the country in recent
months, warning that the problem is contributing to power supply shortages
in summer months, when hot weather sends electricity demand - and prices -
soaring.

Richardson says Congress needs to enact a comprehensive bill restructuring
the $215 billion electric industry to end the uncertainty and give the
sector renewed incentive to make needed investments. By Bryan Lee;Dow Jones

Conference in Houston


Dear Ms. Kaminsky:
As I just mentioned on your voicemail, Infocast is going to host a  Managing
Summer Price Volatility course, January 30 - February 1, 2001 in Houston.
The course will focus on the various tools at hand to manage summer price
and load volatility.  Our target audience for this event will primarily be
risk managers and managers in bulk power sales & purchase (our secondary
target audience is energy traders).

Attached you will find a draft program agenda for your review.  Please let
me know if you or someone else at Enron is interested in presenting at this
event.  In particular, we are looking for someone to talk about weather
derivatives.

I appreciate you taking the time to review the conference schedule and I
hope that I will have an opportunity to talk to you. Unfortunately, I am
running behind schedule in finalizing this program.  I will call tomorrow to
see what your feedback is.  If you have any questions or suggestions, please
do not hesitate to contact me at (818) 888-4445 ext. 30.

Sincerely,

Britta Bothe

Had a great time this weekend.  I'm sure glad that Travis got another good 
buck under his belt.  I think he is now ready to move it up a notch on the 
next deer and if everything stays good at the ranch then it should be pretty 
possible next year.

I was also wondering if you and Mama talked about paying Melissa for her 
painting.  Mama mentioned to Melissa that she ""owed"" her but nothing more 
than that.  She worked for no less than 20 hours and was disappointed that 
she would not be able to do the rest of the house as we really need the 
money.  Our negative checking balance needs some injection of cash and 
Melissa had hoped to use the money to buy a few things for Christmas this 
week as well.   If you haven't already, I'm sure that you can broach the 
subject with Mama without letting her know that I asked.

Anyway,  Melissa really wanted to be able to paint more and is upset that she 
wasn't able to ""prove"" to Mama that she is willing and able to work hard.  
She still gets those not so subtle jabs all the time from Mama about not 
working outside the home.  For the record, she busts her ass keeping our 
house clean, clothes washed and ironed, meals cooked, and doing lots of 
things to make sure we have a happy, healthy, and well adjusted son.   If 
there is a way (later) that you can subtly encourage Mama to hold back on 
these jabs when we next visit, it will go a long way toward ensuring a good 
Christmas for everyone.

Anyway, definitely keep all of this confidential between me and you.  There 
is no major problem here but I wanted to check off with you on this so we can 
help keep everything going smooth and folks getting along.   I'm sure you see 
my point of view here.


Thanks!

I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL.  Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term ""protocol"" into these discussions.  To clarify, according to Anne, the ""protocol"" is not anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, Anne envisions simply e:mails or memos between Enron and AEP with regard to any sharing of information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.  Operational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (Enron) to Steve Jackson (AEP).  

Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally documented.  Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with Enron's treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron's Treasury group for her review.  Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.  

We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require actions by Enron will be our ""to do"" list.  Each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list or which appear in both the Enron and AEP list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written ""protocol"".   We will also update you weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and AEP.  

I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches: 

	1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that Brian has a full 		understanding of operational transition items and their status, or 

	2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you.  

Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week.

Just received this.  

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Dear Vince:
?
I am in a somewhat delicate position. One of the  people in the group here 
has asked me to introduce him to you.? As an El  Paso vice president, I 
should not have agreed to do this, and frankly, the guy  should not have 
asked.? But he is clearly very unhappy at El Paso, so, as a  human being, I 
felt it was appropriate. Also, because this guy would have  contacted you 
anyway, with or without my introduction, as a professional  courtesy, I would 
like you to benefit from my experience with this  fellow.
?
The guy's name is Joao Neves (Portugese).? I  think he is reasonably bright 
and seems to have a quite deep understanding of  general finance and 
financial mathematics. He is a manager and feels very  frustrated because he 
had hoped to be promoted to a position of authority.  Instead the group's 
M.D. brought in two Price-Waterhouse-Coopers consultants as  V.P's to run the 
structuring and quant sides of the group. In this respect, I  can understand 
his unhappiness. Unfortunately for him, however, I also think it  is in his 
nature to whine.? I have observed him to bad mouth lots of people  starting 
with the IT guys (ok, that's perhaps not much an indictment!) all the  way to 
dismissing Broadie & Glasserman's or Eduardo Schwartz' works as  shoddy or 
shallow.? He does not seem to suffer well people he considers  fools.? Caveat 
Emptor, therefore! Having said all this, I do want to  emphasize that he is a 
bright guy, is very pleasant with me, and, perhaps given  the appropriate 
environment and supervision, might be quite productive.?  But don't take my 
word for it. Talk to him, and see what you think.?  Obviously, I would ask 
that you keep these comments in confidence. I have given  you an honest 
assessment -- brutally so.
?
'Nuff said! I have fulfilled my moral obligations  both to Joao and to you.
?
Best Regards,
Grant."

My response to the questions would be that they get the proxy price during
the mitigated intervals when they do not have a bid in.  If they have a bid
in, they get the higher of the proxy or the bid and they submit the cost
justification to FERC.  Right?
Who do they send cost justification to?

Keoni:

In addition to my questions below, can you clarify what we get paid when
we are inc'd pursuant to the FERC Order?  Is the proxy the inc? If we do
not have a bid in, do we get the inc?  If we have a supplemental bid in,
do we get the higher of the inc or the bid?   If we do get the higher
of, to whom do we send our cost data?

Deal #157288

Days:  3/11-3/31 (gas is not a part of the exchange agreement).  

I need to have the spot deal placed on a different deal ticket than the

Will you break out this spot deal separately?



Thanks for fixing the price for the ETXG gas system in March.

Also, I need to have the price for the East Texas redelivery changed in 
Sitara from HS Index $-.085 to HS Index $-.0825.  This is per the contract 
the price for this redelivery point. 

Thanks

Indigestion 
Daniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01 

All those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not.
For natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE's Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid. 

Ah, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as $10 last year. (A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation's electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen. 

Studness determined that 79% of the ""new"" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there's plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand. 

Coal's advantage over gas: It's cheap. Utilities paid an average of $1.20 per million Btu for coal last year, compared with $4.30 for gas (delivered). Even with depressed gas prices, many coal plants are still cheaper to operate. So while those new turbines being installed by Calpine (nyse: CPN - news - people) and other independent power producers, (see table, below) will burn a lot of gas, they will do it mostly at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much. 

 
Addressing a Burning Issue 
If natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn.  
  

WINNERS  			Sales* ($bil) 	Remarks 
Calpine 				$4.6 		Its gas power plants won't compete with coal for years 
Chesapeake Energy 		0.9 		Hedged gas production through December 2003 
Dynegy 			43.4 		Owns gas, coal power plants; stores, trades gas 
Peabody Energy 		2.7 		World's largest coal company 

LOSERS  			Sales* ($bil) 	Remarks

General Electric 		129.5 		Sells gas turbines

Transocean SedcoForex 	1.9 		$4 billion in debt; heavy gas-drilling exposure 
   
*Latest 12 months. Source: Market Guide via FactSet Research Systems. 

""It's not our game to compete with coal or nuclear,"" says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build gas-fired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. ""It's our game to displace older gas."" 

Combined-cycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. The oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500. Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day. 

That scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houston-based Dynegy, an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. Dynegy's 35-year-old coal plants are ""huge capital hogs,"" Bergstrom says, that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. Throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down, Bergstrom says. 

But coal-plant owners can be ingenious. Witness Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. By changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output from the 40-year-old plants 12% last year--while reducing emissions. John Long, vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks he can coax another 15% increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules. 

Long term, the bullish scenario still holds: Gas will displace coal. In the meantime, gas producers have a lot of bonds to retire.

		 Subject: El Paso Merchant Comments on Reporting Requirements

El Paso Merchant filed comments yesterday in the Reporting Requirements 
docket.  They did not argue against the collection of the new proposed data, 
but rather argued that the Commission needed to add to the information to be 
gathered to include financial market data.  El Paso states that the financial 
market is believed to be ten times as large as the physical market.  El Paso 
suggests the following information be collected:
the name of the counter party to the financial trade
the quantitiy of gas underlying the financial trade
all the pricing terms of the trade stated in price per MMBtu
the time period of the trade, including starting and ending dates
the date on which the deal was entered into
the type of trade

El Paso Merchant also argues for confidential treatment and a sunset date for 
the collection of the data (tied to when EIA finds supply and demand in 
California in balance.)

I have a fax of the comments, but do not yet have them electronically.  Let 
me know if you want a copy faxed.

Pamela,
I have 6 electronic tickets that were issued for travel on Continental on
September 26 through the 28th, 2001.  These travelers were to attend the
Southern Gas Association (SGA) Energy Accounting and Marketing Services
Conference in New Orleans.  Due to the Terrorist attacks, the conference was
cancelled.  I realize the date 9/26/01 falls outside the deadline for
allowing re-issuance of tickets with non-refundable fares without penalty or
administrative fee.  However, these Enron employees have asked me to
approach Continental on their behalf and request that their tickets be
re-issued to attend the conference on its rescheduled dates (January 16-18,
2002) without penalty.  I will be happy to supply a copy of the
cancellation/reschedule notice sent out by conference director, or any other
supporting documentation that might suffice.

The six travelers/ticket numbers/prices are as follows:
BLAIR/GRACE LYNN / 005-7033562204 / $136.30
CALLANS/NANCY / 005-7033562205 / $136.30

Thank you in advance for anything you may be able to do to help these Enron
travelers.

All best,
Elizabeth

Vince:

I enjoyed the lunch and part of your presentation last week (I had an other
engagement to attend to, and hence could not make it to the rest of the
presentation and reception following it).

I appreciate the part-time offer, however, I must admit that I did not find
the terms very favorable. Unlike a person who is permamently located in
Houston, I would have the inconvenience and cost of commuting between
Austin
and Houston, and of accomodation both in Austin and Houston.

I really would love to work in the Research Group and am sincere about
this.
I would just hope that you would consider compensating me at manager level
so that I can cover transportation, accomodation expenses and more
importantly, justify the decision to devote at least half of my time to
Enron away from my thesis.

I will be looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,
Cantekin Dincerler

Subject: Coral, CMS and Petro Canada

I have two counterparties that we have invoiced for gas on December 13th - 
Coral and CMS.  In both cases I am being told that this gas is also  being 
invoiced by Petro-Canada and that it was baseload and at a cheaper price than 
what we are invoicing them for.

The deal numbers are  CMS Marketing  #529459 22000 @ 9.10 = $200200.00
    Coral   #529442 8000 @ 8.90 = $71200.00

Both counterparties have stated that they will not pay our invoiced amount.  
Is it possible that these deals should be invoiced to Petro-Canada instead of 
CMS and Coral?  Would you let me know what the resolution is?

Thanks  for your assistance

John,

Could you do me a big favor.  Sherry has been really working hard and doing a 
good job.  Do you think that you could talk with one of your contacts and get 
her a pair of Rockets tickets.  I know they are a playing the Clippers 
tommorrow night.   I know that no one else wants to see the Clippers, but 
she's never been to a game and would really appreciate it.

Thanks,

Errol, X5-8274

Stuck on the phone so I thought I'd email you.  Stan has asked Mike Moran if 
TW has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under ""anti 
gouging"" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can't 
charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of 
water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things:
1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cal. state law 
would probably be the best place to start)
2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices 
ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the CPUC whacks 
the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its 
not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gas 
sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that 
happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for 
transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 
Monday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan's staff meeting (no written memo 
necessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s 
to be done.  Thanks df    "

Dear Tana Jones:

The New York Mercantile Exchange is excited and we want to tell you why.
NYMEX is about to launch enymexsm  and its prospects are invigorating.

Over-the-counter (OTC) participants will now be able to execute transactions
on the same platform as NYMEX futures.  The Exchange plans to use its proven
clearing infrastructure to introduce complete counter-party risk management,
and create net margining with Exchange futures markets by calculating a
consolidated clearing position.  Subsequent enymexsm functionality will also
provide an internet-based interface to the established Exchange futures
market by routing futures orders to the trading floor and the NYMEX ACCESSc
electronic trading system, depending on the session.

Attached please find information announcing the first slate of products to
be offered for listing on enymexsm .

Since we value your business as a forerunner in this industry, we are
enclosing for your review the sale registration form, which consists of the
enymexsm System User Agreement.  Please review, sign and return to Robert A.
Dagistino, Director of Customer Service, New York Mercantile Exchange, One
North End Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10282.  Any questions can be answered via
email at rdagistino@nymex.com or via telephone at 212-299-2429.

The signatory must be an executive officer or partner of the firm.  We are
also attaching two ""click-on screens"" that users will view when they first
log on to the system.

Please note that since the enymexsm products will be cleared you will also
need to obtain authorization from a clearing member for your account.

A NYMEX team, consisting of members of our Board, local traders and staff,
will be visiting each one of you in person.  They will discuss with you how
to utilize the benefits of NYMEX to achieve precision in many of your
customized transactions.

We look forward to receiving your registration and participation in what is
intended to be the premier, global exchange for forward trading and clearing
contracts focusing on energy and metals products.

Sincerely,

 <<...OLE_Obj...>>
Neal Wolkoff,
Executive Vice President

Checked with EES - Bob Badeer's deals are off peak. They've been changed.

515040 - changed last night to 275

Sean Crandall is entering the last deal right now. I'll let you know the deal 
number in a minute.

Thanks,
Kate

Hi John. It was really good to hear from you. As  well I think you have a good idea of what I think of your corporate success. Not  to take away, in any way, what I think of you and the family on a personal  basis. give them all my love.
 
John, I did send you the article on David Cassie's  compensation at CIBC World Markets.
 
Could you e-mail me your new title [to update my files] and  business address.
 
Thanks
 
Uncle Frank."

I am confused.  Perhaps we can all get on a call and talk to determine how we 
can best coordinate the various matters.  My experience is that often the 
confirm and annex issues relate and need to be coordinated together if the 
counterparty has comments.  Per your note I will continue to do the Powerex 
deal for now.  

By copy to Taffy I request that you set up a conference call with Greg, Tana, 
Mark and myself as soon as our schedules all permit.  Thanks.

No, I do not think so.  I think we might have a misunderstanding on the 
separation of roles between ECC and ENA.  ECC legal will do the legal work in 
assisting the Calgary confirm desk in preparing the actual confirms, 
amendments, terminations, etc.  However, ENA legal will continue to handle 
all legal matters or inquiries with respect to the negotiation and 
interpretation of the contracts surrounding the confirms which, I assume, 
would include the negotiation and interpretation of matters such as the 
financial GTC forms.  Therefore, I would suspect that the negotiation of the 
terms of the GTC between ECC and PowerEX, for example, would still be handled 
by ENA.  Also, as a result, I would suspect that the guarantees would also be 
coordinated with Clement through ENA.  Perhaps Mark Taylor can clarify on 
these points.

Cheers

Greg

Hi guys,

Just wanted to check to see if there is a ""go by"" affiliate EPC contract,

Okay...I'm an idiot...I forgot to bring your email address with me to London (it's saved in my contacts list at work) and I can't check my work email from outside locations...augh!  Yet again, I fail.  However, I had such a good time visiting I think I'm going to try to make a quick trip back over this fall when the air fares are a little cheaper.  That way, I could see you and Jessica and Clay.  I will stick your phone number in my physical address book and be a better visitor next go-round.

Sorry again for the oversight.  Also, the next trip I make will most likely be solo (my roommate in Houston came with me this time) so it will be significantly easier for me to maneuver.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Any luck on the roommate front?  Do you still want me to talk to Millie?

Capacity Marketing - TW sold 35,000 MMBtu/d of firm transport to Sempra 
Energy Trading at a negotiated rate of $0.50/MMBtu plus fuel for the two year 
period beginning January 1, 2004.  The path is from Blanco to SoCal Needles; 
contract value is $12.8MM.  In addition, Sempra waived its right to utilize 
its call option for 21,500 MMBtu/d of capacity at $0.30/MMBtu during this 
two-year period.

TW also sold 14,000 MMBtu/d of firm transport to Calpine for two years 
beginning Jan. 1, 2004 at a floating rate based on the difference between the 
California border and the San Juan Blanco indices.  The primary delivery 
point is Calpine's newly constructed power plant on the Topock lateral.  The 
floating price can currently be hedged to yield a gross margin of 
$0.80/MMBtu, with a contract value (net of fuel) of $6.1MM.

BP/Amoco was one of several interested parties last week as TW marketed the 
remaining large blocks of our East capacity.  BP has come back to TW with an 
offer, based on available space, of $0.02/MMBtu for demand plus a sharing 
mechanism for alternate deliveries west.  The proposed term is for 2001 April 
- October.  We are working with Facility Planning to determine the available 
space.

Gas Inventory - TW continued to experience high line pressure and pack out 
west this week.  This necessitated an additional sale of line pack gas of 
15,000 MMBtu for a gross revenue of $277,500.

El Paso Natural Gas Co. - Bids were due Monday (2/12) for the 1.2 Bcf/d of 
west capacity on El Paso.  They marketed the space in 5 blocks of various 
capacities;  minimum bid was 100% of the max California reservation rate for 
a minimum term of 1 month.  Market intelligence indicates over 144 bids were 
submitted for max terms of 5 years.  El Paso indicated the award announcement 
will be made the week of 2/19.  El Paso Merchant will likely exercise their 
ROFR right and take the space at max rates for 5 years.

   Subject:  emissions market

   Dear Mr. Massey:

   I am working with the World Bank in Prototype Carbon Fund projects (i.e.
   for
   emissions reduction and associated carbon purchase).
   In particular, I am doing some research on the development of carbon
   markets in
   Latin America (e.g. potential to compete for CDM projects, carbon market
   development, participating agents, etc). I am also conducting research
   on the
   actions that multinational energy companies are taking with respect to
   the Kyoto
   Protocol.

   Thanks to my work I had the opportunity to meet Glenn Prickett,
   executive
   director of the Center for Environmental Leadership in Business at
   Conservation
   International who advised me to contact Susan Worthen at Enron. Susan
   also
   contacted me with Mr. Henry Van who mentioned that you are the director
   of Enron
   Emission Allowances.

   If possible, could you send me some information on Enron's development
   in carbon
   markets and in general on the Enron's experience in emissions trading?.
   Also,
   let me know if I can call you to have a brief conversation.

   All the best,

   Gabriela Elizondo



   I wish to express my condolences to the people of America.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you
made from selling Enron stock before the company declared
bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and
REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their
retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers
in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.
Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California
consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of
Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company
declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.
And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California
energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of
consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the
largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of
Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to
keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to
help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's
underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

judith lamb"

Private message.
Cynthia has dramatically increased her attacks on me in recent days--I've had 
""warnings"" from a number of people.
She's openly saying that I have no Hill experience, she has attacked my use 
of outside consultants, she has challenged my handling of the BLM/Forest 
Service issue.
Today I heard about a message she sent to someone outside the company, 
""suggesting"" to them that they never meet with me alone, but always have 
Chris Long present, and further that any communications with me in the future 
copy Scott and Donald.  In short, she's now trying to undercut my authority 
not just inside the office, but outside the office as well.
I've requested a meeting Thursday morning with Joe and Cynthia.  My strategy 
will be to say to Cynthia ""if there's anything you want to say to me, now is 
the time,"" and to turn to Joe and say ""You supervise both of us and I 
appreciate your being here to help us sort this out.""
But my patience is wearing very, very thin."

Dear Vince and Stinson,

Today I announced my resignation from Enron. It's been very interesting and exciting 5 years and I enjoyed working with you. But for various reasons I decided that I need a fresh start in a new place. So I am moving to New York to trade crude oil financial derivatives for HETCO. I may stick around for a couple of weeks to finish up some stuff, the management should tell me today what they want. But if I leave today and cannot stop by to say good bye, then good luck to you and thanks for giving me the opportunity to work at Enron. I can be reached at pzadoro@yahoo.com.

iles are highly confidential and no one should have access unless you so de=
signate.  My message was a general one that went out to everyone in the dep=
artment.  It's up to each individual to give access (or not) to whatever th=
ey would like a temp to use in order to support them in their Assistant's a=
bsence.  We have set up the temporary ID's as per Mark Haedicke's office to=
 give access mainly to calendars only in order to help the temp field phone=
 calls, make appointments, and to generally let the temp know where everyon=
e is in case Mr. Haedicke is looking for someone.

Becky,

Given the nature of what I do, no one in my group will be able to provide t=
hese types of temporary rights to documents or calendar entries.  I do not =
believe that any of the other temporary ID's have access to our stuff, so I=
 would think that these new IDs would be the same.

I hope that does not pose a problem, but I believe that the confidentiality=

Subject: New Temp IDs



Since our department has grown, we have realized the need to add 3 new temp=
orary IDs.  Following the instructions below, please add calendar access ri=
ghts for EWS Legal Temp IDs 9, 10, and 11 (as show in blue below). While do=
ing this, would you mind checking the other IDs as well to be sure they are=
 listed.  When logging in temporaries we have discovered that some access r=
ights work with some temp IDs, but not all.  Thank you!

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=20
For Outlook users only!=20

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e=
-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently,=
 the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to O=
utlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights =
to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control h=
ow much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you coul=
d give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail =
or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to y=
ou.

Please give access to the following IDs:=20
EWS Legal Temp 1=20
EWS Legal Temp 2=20
EWS Legal Temp 3=20
EWS Legal Temp 4=20
EWS Legal Temp 5=20
EWS Legal Temp 6=20
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.=20
EWS Legal Temp 8=20
EWS Legal Temp 9=20
EWS Legal Temp 10=20
EWS Legal Temp 11=20

To set up access:=20
1.      Right click on ""Outlook Today"" at the top of the folders list (if y=
our folders list is not visible, click on ""View"" and

        then ""Folder List"")=20

2.      Left Click on ""Properties"" at the bottom of the list that pops up=
=20

3.      Left click on the ""Permissions"" tab=20

4.      Left click on ""Add"".=20
        Type ""EWS""-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.=20
        Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the =
""Add"" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not

        to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)=20
        Left Click ""OK""=20

5.      You should now be back in the ""properties"" box.  Select the first I=
D you just added, hold down the ""Shift"" key, then

        left click all the other ID's.  With all IDs now selected and not h=
olding the Shift key down, click in the boxes which

        access you would like to allow the temporaries to have.  (Note:  Do=
 not select anything that has ""own"" or ""owner""

        in it as you are the owner.)  Left Click on ""Apply"", then ""OK"".=20

6.      Right click on your ""Calendar"" folder and repeat steps 2-5 above.=
=20

7.      [Optional].  To give access to e-mail or any other folders you may =
have, right click on that folder and repeat steps

         2-5 above.=20

Regarding the Legal Temp IDs, these set-up instructions need to be complete=
d only once. If your Assistant ever changes, these instructions will come i=
n handy!

Thank you for your time and patience."

F.Y.I.

                              
  California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs 
  By Rebecca Smith 
    
  09/01/2000 
  The Wall Street Journal 
  Page A4 
  (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

  California lawmakers voted to extend modest relief to San Diego residents 
burdened with
  high electricity bills and set the groundwork for faster construction of 
badly needed power
  plants. They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would roll 
back retail power
  rates to levels seen prior to deregulation .

  Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to 6.5 
cents per
  kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric 
Co. can be
  charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other reasonable 
costs to that
  commodity price.

  The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is far 
higher than the
  average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's market 
has been
  deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by 
the utility from a
  state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents, 
respectively, compared
  with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier.

  Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near 
mutiny. The
  rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, as 
well as to
  schools and hospitals.

  In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by 
the California
  Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature earmarked 
$150 million of
  general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs 
if they greatly
  exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would be 
expected to make
  up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost.

  Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric 
Co., said the
  rate-cap measure is ""deeply flawed"" because it limits the amount prices can 
rise but sets
  no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for 
customers to pay
  it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until 
December 2002 or
  December 2003.

  Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664 
million, provided
  future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices 
through
  December 2002. ""It's irreparably damaging to Sempra,"" he said because it 
""creates
  tremendous uncertainty"" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company 
to finance
  new projects such as a new transmission line.

  The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the 
permit process for the
  construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of 
regulatory agencies that
  review the plans.

Andy,

Per our recent discussions, you will find a proposal from Enron Compression Services to provide HP Services to KNG Energy to meet it growth expectations (either as is or through a new joint venture/ownership structure from the current bidding process).  We have made this proposal to conform with the expansion scenarios outlined in the offering memorandum and have provided flexibility for a 60%-90% load factor to be utilized for both stations.  We would be happy to have a tele-conference to go through this proposal with you.  You will also note that the latter part of the presentation begins to outline additional options (on a notional value basis) that we can put into a deal to increase the value of the deal over the proposed 10-year term.

We took a look at the strategic value of the underlying assets that were offered and were unfortunately not able to come up with a structure that we could support for either the purchase or re-capitalization of KNG Energy's assets.  We appreciate the opportunity to bid on these assets and are happy to work with you to optimize our proposal to fit the ultimate owner's needs for expansion.

I have also attached our group's brochure and a copy of a recent article about our group in Gas Daily.  Once again, thank you for the opportunity and I will call you in the near future to discuss this proposal further.

Chris Hilgert
Director
Enron Compression Services

 
  

The parties hereto understand and agree that the PROPOSAL sets forth each party's preliminary understanding of the proposed transactions with KNG EnerGY and Enron compression services.  This PROPOSAL does not create and is not intended to create a binding and enforceable contract between the parties or a duty on the part of any party hereto to negotiate in good faith toward a binding contract and may not be relied upon by either party as the basis for a contract by estoppel or otherwise, but rather this proposal evidences a non-binding expression of the understanding of each party to endeavor, without obligation, to negotiate the terms of a proposed transaction.

night.  I have to come in on the week-end because air-fares are horrible 
without  a Saturday night stay and I'd rather stay the week-end in San 
Diego.  If you have any time on Sunday or can meet me on Monday  for

Hi Kate, Lindy Conrad a trader from Seattle City Light called me today.  She 
thinks the price for deal # 537565.01 should be $360.00 instead of $350.00.  
She said that Sean Crandall was our trader.  

Let me know what you find out.
Thanks,
Melissa"

       Fruits Of The Spirit
        Max Lucado)

       It's quiet. It's early. My coffee is hot. The sky is still black. The
 world is still asleep. The day is coming.

       In a few moments the day will arrive. It will roar down the track with
 the rising of the sun. The stillness of the dawn will be exchanged for the
 noise of the day. The calm of the solitude will be replaced by the pounding
 pace of the human race. The refuge of the early morning will be invaded by
 decisions to be made and deadlines to be met.

       For the next twelve hours I will be exposed to the day's demands. It
 is now that I must make a choice. Because of Calvary, I'm free to choose.
 And so I choose.

       I choose love... No occasion justifies hatred; no injustice warrants
 bitterness, I choose love. Today I will love God and what God loves.

       I choose joy... I will invite my God to be the God of circumstance. I
 will refuse the temptation to be cynical...the tool of the lazy thinker. I
 will refuse to see people as anything less than human beings, created by
 God. I will refuse to see any problem as anything less than an opportunity
 to see God.

       I choose peace... I will live forgiven. I will forgive so that I may
 live.

       I choose patience... I will overlook the inconveniences of the world.
 Instead of cursing the one who takes my place, I'll invite him to do so.
 Rather than complaining that the wait is too long, I will thank God for a
 moment to pray. Instead of clinching my fist at new assignments, I will face
 them with joy and courage.

       I choose kindness... I will be kind to the poor, for they are alone.
 Kind to the rich, for they are afraid. And kind to the unkind, for such is
 how God has treated me.

       I choose goodness... I will go without a dollar before I take a
 dishonest one. I will be overlooked before I will boast. I will confess
 before I will accuse. I choose goodness.

       I choose faithfulness... Today I will keep my promises. My debtors
 will not regret their trust. My associates will not question my word. My
 wife will not question my love. And my children will never fear that their
 father will not come home.

       I choose gentleness... Nothing is won by force. I choose to be gentle.
 If I raise my voice may it be only in praise. If I clench my fist, may it be
 only in prayer. If I make a demand, may it be only of myself.

       I choose self-control... I am a spiritual being. After this body is
 dead, my spirit will soar. I refuse to let what will rot, rule the eternal.
 I choose self-control. I will be drunk only by joy. I will be impassioned
 only by my faith. I will be influenced only by God. I will be taught only by
 Christ. I choose self-control.

       Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
 gentleness, and self-control. To these I commit my day. If I succeed, I will
 give thanks. If I fail, I will seek His grace. And then when this day is
 done, I will place my head on my pillow and rest. >>

Faith:

Please find the attached budget for TX Gas Orig per Louise's request.  I have compared the budget distributed by David Vandor to the budget submitted to the Office of the Chair last September (adjusted for a smaller head count).  This is located under the Natural Gas Orig - Texas tab in the attached spreadsheet.

My main comments are as follows:

1.  Travel and Entertainment seems a bit low as we need to be meeting with/signing up/marketing to a new customer base. 
2.  NetCo will need to pay for outside engineering and technical services as our in-house staff has been reduced (pipeline mapping, flow analysis)
3.  The Supplies number for NetCo seems low given past expenditures.

Please call or email me if you need anything else.

Saturday - March 31 - Columbus - 8:00 AM - 56 miles - (hilly)
Here is the Conoco series, sponsored by Steve Moskowitz - This is ride #12, 
and there are 14 in the series, at a cost of $20 total.  Questions:  Patrick 
Scales at Enron - 713-345-3673.

You read the note right - it says we're starting from COLUMBUS, Tx!

Sorry this note is a day late and still missing a key detail - the exact
starting location - but due to the Round Top/Warrenton Antique Fair (100,000
visitors/day), we felt we needed to modify our route this Saturday.  There
is a hilly 56 mile route which starts in Columbus and covers many of the
same challenging hills as the ride originally planned but stays away from
Round Top, Warrenton, and Fayetteville and the busy roads immediately around
these towns.

Weekly Ride - Columbus, TX, Sat, 3/31 - 8 am

This week, we'll still get our hill training in and will have the
opportunity to climb the same hill (Lone Oak) that we would have had to
climb on the New Ulm route.  This ride is a 56 mile loop starting in
Columbus, hitting Lone Oak and Frelsburg and picking up beautiful
Zimmerscheidt Road going the other direction.  The Rides Around Houston book
gives this ride a score of ""9"" for exercise potential so look for some
hills.

The ride will start at 8:00 am sharp.  Columbus is an hour from the Sam
Houston Tolway/I-10 intersection so please allow yourself time to arrive in
Columbus by 7:15 am.

Directions to the Start - Beason's Park
We have permission to use Beason's Park as the starting off point.  Someone
is using the pavilion from 2:00pm to 7:00pm, and I told Judy that most of us
would be gone by then and we didn't really need the pavilion.  Beason's Park
does have restrooms, however, I will not vouch for the condition.

Beason's park is on US 90 just east of Columbus.  The most direct way is to
take I-10 to exit 698 (US 90 exit) and take US 90 west.  The park is on the
left hand side of the road just before the bridge over the Colorado river.
For those of you (like us) coming from Magnolia/The Woodlands the best way
is to take FM 949 to I-10.  We stay on the feeder which becomes US 90 at
exit 698.

If you want to pick up food or go to the bathroom before the ride, stay on
I-10 until exit 696 (Hwy 71).  There are convenience stores and bathrooms at
this exit.  At this point you can either take Hwy 71 north to US 90 and turn
right (east) to get to the park (which will be on your right just after the
bridge) or get back on I-10 to exit 698.

NOTE - As we get out into the country, I highly recommend stopping at the
local stores for your sport drinks, water, and a quick rest stop.  Your
drinks will be colder this way, you will have a timely rest stop, and the
local business will look forward to our return.

Here's a few reminders for those of you who are new to the list or have a
short memory:

Starting Time - 8:00 am - SHARP!
There were a lot of riders pulling into Cat Springs at 7:55 last Saturday.
If you arrive in Columbus after 7:30 and aren't fast at bike prep and
signing in, you'll get left at the start this week.  PLEASE allow time to
get to Columbus between 7:15 and 7:30.  Even though we're not riding to
Warrenton, we want to be off the roads as early as possible.

Check-in Process
Every rider is expected to sign in to indicate that they have started the
ride and sign-out on their return.  We have no way of knowing that you are
on the road and may need assistance if you don't sign in.  PLEASE arrive
early enough to sign in and remember to sign out when you finish the ride.

If you have completed the online or paper waiver, your name will appear on
the alphabetical sign-in sheets.  They are split up into groups of 5-6
sheets to speed up the sign in process so look for the clip board with your
name.  If this is your first ride and you haven't signed up online, you need
to complete a paper waiver and fill in your name on the blank sign-in sheet.
If you completed a paper waiver last Saturday and your name is not listed on
the alpha list, it's because you didn't sign the waiver (3 of you), you
signed one but didn't provide any emergency information, or I just couldn't
read your handwriting (5 VERY sloppy waivers last week!).  PLEASE arrive
early enough to fill out a legible waiver or slow down a minute when filling
it out.

I hate to harp on these details but it is vital that everyone help out to
ensure that you have a safe and fun ride.

Thanks!

Mike:  This should offer a guide to developing legislation that narrows PUC 
review of utility purchases to approval of the competitive solicitation used 
by the utility to procure the contracts.  We have consistently argued against 
being prescriptive (i.e., the contracts should be of 3 years long, less than

FYI.   Long Ridge Farm Energy is adding two new meters to their existing 
contract.  The meters are going to be in the South pool and the information 
is as follows :

Meter #-3576601 Well Name-Bartlett  County-Ritchie  State-WV  Est. Vol.-10

Meter#-3584401  Well Name-Roberts  County-Ritchie  State-WV  Est. Vol.-2

These are big money makers. Ha

Sara:

Thanks for the additional information and the recommended changes, each of
which we accept.

In order to accommodate the deletion of 9(b), we recommend revising your
number 6 to read as follows:

6. Substitution

 (a) Paragraph 9(b) is hereby deleted in its entirety.

 (b) Seller shall not retain custody of any Purchased Securities
under any Transaction governed by this Agreement.

NOTICES:  Your suggested language regarding notices is potentially
problematic.  Under the Paragraph 13 of the MRA, notices may made orally,
""to be confirmed promptly in writing...."", and confirmation of delivery is
not expressly relevant.  The unquestionable ability to make oral margin
calls pursuant to Paragraph 4 is vital in fast-moving market conditions, and
was expressly included in the standard agreement to avoid any doubt as to
their validity.  In the default context (Paragraph 11), proof of delivery of
written notice is of no concern because the exercise of a party's rights
under that Paragraph is not contingent upon delivery of notice.  Notice must
be given ""as promptly as practicable.""  We believe that the proposed
language could cause confusion or uncertainty regarding the validity of oral
margin calls and would conflict with the operative provisions of Paragraph
11.  We therefore request deletion of your number 8.

NON-ASSIGNABILITY:  As we discussed earlier today, we have a general
aversion to assignments of repurchase transactions due to our regulatory
obligations as a broker-dealers.  For that reason, we must be free to
withhold consent to assignment with confidence that such withholding will
not be challenged as ""unreasonable.""  We therefore request deletion of your
number 9.

We are still reviewing your proposals regarding SETOFF and LIMITED
LIABILITY.  I will also have to review Section 5-1401 of the NYGOL before
commenting on that.

I look forward to the prompt completion of our negotiations.  Thanks again
for the information and recommendations.

Best regards,
Andy Waskow

A meeting has been scheduled on 3/16 with the California Fish and Game to 
discuss the following issues:  1)presentaiton of the 1999 and 2000 annual 
reports which are required by the facility's 2081 permit. 2) developing an 
agreement with F&G as to how the 41 acre credits held by EOTT will be managed 
to ensure compliance with requirements of the F&G. 3) Presentation of the 
results relating to surveys conducted in the path of construction for the 
Rogas project.

The waiver to lay pipeline above ground for the Rogas constsruction was 
approved by the Offfice of the State Fire Marshall, Pipeline Safety 
Division.  There were 8 city, county, state and federal agencies notified by 
application for approval to construct the 9 mile pipline system consisting of 
3 piplines.  This is the only agency approval received as yet.

Acre credits were obtained from Aera for the construction of the Rogas 
pipeline.  Aera is an oil company with major holdings of acreage available 
for purchase.  It was felt that due to the time constraints for initiating 
this project and the concern with not receiving the credits from the F&G that 
EOTT would purchase Aera credits to ensure procurement of the necessary 
acreage for the Rogas project.  This is a major plus for the project.

The rough draft of the baseline noise survey for the turbine installations in 
Az. was received.  Some changes will be made in each document.,  as the 
contractor has made some obvious conclusions and asumptions which are not 
valid or representative of the mitigation Transwetern will do.  The Navajo 
Nation has requested that an onsite survey be conducted at the C/S on the 
reservation (C/S 3 and 4)  for T&E plants and animals and archeology.  A 
contractor has been notified and surveys will be completed by 3/12. The F-1 
environmental report  for the FERC application will be submitted to Donna by 
this friday.   

The air permit applications for C/S 1 and 2 have been started.   A meeting 
with EPA in San Francisco has abeen set to discuss permitting the C/S 
facilities on the reservation on 3/20.  After the meeting, applications 
should be in front of the Navajo air permitting agency and the EPA within a 
week. Air permits are expected  within 5-7 months after submittal of the 
application.  During a conference call this week, a proposal was submitted to 
remove the existing auxillary generators and replace with 2 units at each 
location.  This will delay submittal of the air applications 3-4 days, 
assuming no major issues result.  One interesting issue that might develop is 
that one of the generators might possibly be a wind turbine.  "

I am sending you the Capacity Allocation Agreement Summary.  For a summary, 
it is still four pages, but let me know if this is the sort of thing you were 
looking for.  I tried to shorten certain things, but I inserted some of the 
definitions for clarification of what certain terms in the contract meant.  I 
have finished the ""Operating Agreement"" also, but I have to look over it 
before I send it.

I will be by to find out what changes you want me to make either this 
afternoon or on Tuesday if that is better for you.

In response to the below, there was a short planning meeting between 
Commercial Support and IT, specific objectives were identified which would 
enhance the DPR and reporting process, and improve the robustness of our 
processes, the following has been agreed in principle:

1. Commercial groups to input all trades and save out all curves by 6 PM GMT, 
pending agreement from the Office of the Chair.
2. IT to investigate/develop a report showing valuation of new trades, to be 
signed off by risk management before end of day.
3. Full valuation to start at approximately 7 PM GMT.  On completion, a 
comparison of the portfolio valuation will be made to the prior day's 
portfolio valuation and any material (threshold to be specified) movements to 
be reported to risk management ( for consideration of rerun )
4. IT Operations to monitor valuation for software and hardware errors, to be 
reported to technical support in the event of a failure.  

The benefits of this process will be to trap problems early and allow time 
for completion of the rerun of the valuation systems prior to the beginning 
of the next trading day.

Early in the new year we will produce daily process timelines for each 
business area/valuation system for the following:
a) current state
b) proposed interim state without automated trade capture/booking
c) target final state including automated trade capture/booking ( note - 
Market Tracker for UK Power business is currently in system test - 
implementation timelines for other businesses not yet available )

Upon completion of these analyses we will circulate and request full 
commercial signoff

Just to follow up on James's note of yesterday - my apologies for being out

The elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment 
from Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability 
to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and 
I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting 
this change

The revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any 
system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver 
completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks 
in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in 
delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of 
meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we 
will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve 
input validation processes on trade date.

Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to 
deliver

Officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy 
is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( 
Houston 4 AM )
Flash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )
Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( 
Houston 11AM )

James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible 
changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in 
addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of 
delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in 
delivering a trade date control process.

I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we 
are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. 
Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.

Regards

Mike

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

James

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys 
initiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick

Fraters,

Thank you to the guys that came on Saturday for the BBQ/Game.  I can speak 
for the house in saying that we enjoyed having you come down.  We look 
forward to the next time we can get together.

For those who missed it, we will be having more events to come in the near 
future.  This includes a Golf Tournament, alumni/rush event, and more 
football in the fall.  Stay tuned for details!

Also, I would appreciate it if you could take the time time to fill out this 
survey:

http://www.orst.edu/groups/tke/survey.htm

It will help me start and maintain a database of Tau Chapter Alumni.  This 
also will give me an idea of who is reading the emails that I send out.  
Thank you for taking the five minutes out of your time to fill it out.

YITB,

Ryan Hildebrand

THE AMBASSADOR OF GOOD BUSINESS!

UNITED STATES-MEXICO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
Rocky Mountain Regional Chapter
George P. Heinrich, President
Gil Cisneros, Senior Regional Director

THE FOX WATCH!

   1. This IMI presents an overview of what are
expected to be the environmental priorities for Mexico's new administration.
The new administration in Mexico has mentioned the following as priority
areas for development over the next six years.

-Review the present environmental standards (NOM's). Make changes to
increase the compliance of micro, small and mid-sized companies.

-Study ways the private sector can participate in the development of
infrastructure to treat and dispose of industrial waste. Implement programs
to facilitate this.

-Launch special programs for large private consumers of potable water to
encourage the use of recycled water.

-Increase federal expenditures on environmental infrastructure along the
Mexico -U.S. border.


2. Implications for U.S. companies: U.S. manufacturers of equipment and
providers of environmental services should be able to increase their market
share during the next six years because of the priorities mentioned above.

3. Companies interested in selling equipment and services should contact:

CalPX To Ask FERC To Reduce Day-of, Day-Ahead Price Cap:
Board Caves In To Political Pressure

By Jason Leopold

LOS ANGELES--The California Power Exchange, the spot market where electricity 
is
bought and sold in the state, approved a measure Wednesday seeking federal
authority to impose a
$350 per megawatt-hour bid cap on wholesale power prices in its day-of and
day-ahead markets.

Members of the CalPX's board of governors admitted that the measure was 
approved
 as a result of
intense political pressure being placed on the board by state lawmakers and 
Gov.
 Gray Davis.

""Not approving this is political suicide,"" said CalPX board member Carolyn
Keherein, who also serves
on the board of governors at the California Independent System Operator. 
""We're
not changing
anything but the perception in the market.""

The CalPX current cap on wholesale power prices in the day-of and day-ahead
market is set at $2,500,
but that is only a technical limitation of their computer system and has had 
no
effect on power prices.

State lawmakers believe a price cap would stabilize high power prices being
passed on to retail
customers, most notably consumers in San Diego. Ratepayers there are paying
market-based rates for
electricity and have seen their utility bills nearly triple in the past two
months.

The price cap would need to be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission before it goes
into effect at the Power Exchange. FERC has not indicated whether it would OK
the measure, but said
it would investigate it.



If you have any questions, please feel free to call me directly.

I received this from Craig Young yesterday of the MG New York office who 
visited us Sep. 13-15.

If you review the Word document below, he wants me to gather much information 
which
we've been selective in providing to any internal or external party. As you 
know, some of this information is being
provided to Sarah Wesner under the direction of John Arnold and John Lavorato.

Given the current tentative status of MG clearing trades, I am not 
comfortable in providing this data at this time to MG.

However, if you think that we should be of assistance for their own analysis 
to clear/ not to clear trades, please let me know.

Thanks,

David 3-3528

Judge Montali has issued a tentative ruling on the MidSet QF's motion to 
suspend performance under their PPA's.  Click on the link below to view a pdf 
file containing the 27 page decision.

In summary, the Court's tentative ruling is to deny the QF's request to 
suspend the PPA's, to decline to set a deadline for PG&E to assume or reject 
the contract and to find that the reasonable rate that PG&E must pay the QF 
for energy delivered post petition pending assumption or rejection is the 
rate determined by the CPUC in the Wood decision.

The Court then goes on to note that this case is an extraordinary one 
requiring extraordinary relief.  The Court therefore tentatively ruled that 
PG&E should pay some undetermined portion of the pre-petition arrearages to 
the QF's in order to ameliorate the burden on the QF's and help get them back 
(or keep them) online.

The Court therefore ordered PG&E, MidSet and the Committee to meet and confer 
and attempt to reach a resolution of the amount of the arrearage to be paid.  
Judge Montali states that ""he has it in mind"" that the amount perhaps should 
be equal to the difference between the Wood rates and the market price.

Call me if you have any questions or have an trouble with the link.

1.  EnronOnline is not an exchange, it is a bilateral transaction system.  It differs from futures exchanges in many respects including the following:  (i)an Enron entity is a counterparty to every transaction concluded over the system; (ii) EnronOnline transactions are not cleared;  (iii) the transactions concluded on the system are forward contracts or derivatives, not futures; and (iv) access to EnronOnline is restricted to commercial entities, i.e. no retail transactions are concluded on EnronOnline.

3.  EnronOnline transactions are not cleared through any third party mechanism.  Enron evaluates the credit of its customers and determines how much credit exposure it is willing to take with respect to each of them.

Dear Mr. Hermans:
The following are the questions I referred to in the the phone message of 
August 6.

1.  In what significant ways does Enron Online differ from the London Metal 
Exchange or the New York Mercantile Exchange in the trading of futures 
contracts (apart from the specific metals it trades) or from other on-line 
exchanges in the trading of physical metal?

2.  What are the most important benefits that a public exchange like Enron's 
brings to the steel industry?

3.  Does Enron have a trade clearing mechanism to guarantee the 
creditworthiness of suppliers and customers?

4.  Why have some on-line steel trading sites failed?

5.  Are there particular problems in trading steel on-line versus oil, 
agricultural products, or any of the other products that are successfully 
traded on-line?

Any information you are able to supply would be greatly appreciated.

Some weeks ago, Richard sent me copies of some demand letters dated in 
November to the ""ENA Legal Department"" that he suspected had been laying 
around somewhere, and asked me to investigate.  I have had one meeting with 
Enron's mailroom people, who I gave my only copies of those letters.  They 
threw them away, thinking I had finished my investigation.  I have mentioned 
this to Richard and asked him to send me additional copies, but it may have 
slipped his mind.  Can you help me?
Thanks.

Vincent,
Congratulations on spearheading the Mind's Eye Madness event - it looks like
quite a success.  My biggest disappointment is that I am leaving Enron this
week and have been too busy to participate as much as I would like.  I have
had continued interest in the work and presentations that Amy Oberg has
done, so would have really enjoyed the workshop yesterday.  I am still
considering doing some or all of the Motorcade Friday, however that may
work.

Separately, thanks for the update in the lobby today on the Enterprise Risk
project.  Please keep in touch with me.  As I mentioned, my redeployment
period ends tomorrow (April 26), but I currently do not have an outside job
lined up and still have a lot of interest in the project if something can be
worked out over the next few weeks.  Although he is not in the same group as
David Port, I have worked a lot with Brad Larson in the RAC underwriting
group - he may be a good source of information on me also.

  Contact information:
e-mail:   gdarrah@bigfoot.com
phone:    713.668.4277

Subject: Project EWE ll - possible joint bid

It it becomes desirable to structure the Reliant deal off balance sheet, we 
would most likely need a partner, either an industry participant or a 
financial entity.  Some potential industry partners might include Nisource, 
Utilicorp, or Oneok.  (are there others?)  

According to the press, Nisource will need to pay down debt following the 
Columbia merger.  However they have a continuing strategic appetite for LDC 
assets.  They are/will be a registered Utility Holding Company, so obviously 
PUHCA poses no concern for them.  

Here is a possible structure for an Enron/Nisource JV purchase of the Reliant 
package.  Other Nisource and /or Columbia assets could be added to the 
transaction to generate net excess cash for Nisource (presumeably only if ENE 
had a strategic interest in the added assets).

Comments please.

fyi--per our discussion about Lotus Notes and how to use the Out of Office 
feature when you are traveling.

Click on the Actions icon at the top of the page and a list will appear. 
Scroll down to Mail Tools which will bring up another list. Then scroll down 
to the last item which is Out of Office. This will lead you to a page which 
will allow you to put in your departure and return dates and any message you 
wish to send to anyone that emails you during your absence. When you return 
you simply go to the Out of Office page and disable the message. For 
subsequent use you just plug in your new travel dates.

she is seeing all the e-mails from CEE and NFTC on the different activities 
of both organizations.  I told Linda you were the lead on this and all issues 
that deal with the MFAs, and that you served in a leadership role at the 
NFTC.  Please let me know if you need any suport from my side.

Below is a message from a company by the name of Cavio who specializes in 
software that streamlines the settlements process.  More information about 
their products can be found at http://www.cavio.com/.  They would like to 
visit Enron and discuss the potential of partnering with us.  Essentially 
they would charge our customers a fee for the process of clearing or settling 
their transactions and share a portion of the revenue with Enron.  The 
benefit to our customers is a reduced cost for letters of credit.  

Bottom line is that they would like to meet with us and see if their is any 
interest in trying to put something together.  Please let me know if you are 
interested in being a part of the meeting and I will coordinate setting it 
up.  Thanks!  -  Tommy

Dear Tommy, 
Further to my phone message to you on Wednesday morning, I have great news. 
It appears the last points have been ironed out and that CheMatch will be 
going forward with the Cavio Solution.  Our CEO and VP of Sales will be 
attending a meeting with CheMatch in Houston in mid to late January.  As 
well, interest has been shown from the Natural Gas Exchange (www.ngx.com) and 
Automated Power Exchange (www.apx.com).  From our discussions, it has become 
apparent that these two sites currently deal with Enron at some level and 
both agree that the Cavio Solution could effect a positive change in the lag 
time currently seen for billing cycles (up to 55 days) as well as providing 
other benefits.  I feel that with Enron and CheMatch setting a new standard 
with Cavio, many of your current clients will be eager to join, and your 
competition will be left behind.
Based on the fact that you had expressed interest in Cavio and Beta testing 
the Cavio Solution for trades currently happening between Cheats and Enron,  
I think that it may be an ideal time to plan a meeting with your team in 
conjunction with our meeting with CheMatch.  
Please advise as soon as possible. 
Thanks.

Lloyd,
Would it make sense to press our EES/West Point guys to a decision?    We should express that we want to hire internally,  however,  we do have external candidates that we are considering.

The Reliant guy,  Ryan Thomas,   was a good interview and seems to have something positive to prove.   I believe that HR has some specific questions that they wish us to ask regarding his employment at Reliant.

Also,   EES is petitioning Kevin for me to let Watt's go right now.    I have indicated to Terry Donavan that mid July would be preferable due to our being already short staffed.    

Let me know your thoughts on this when you get the chance.    I will be out of the office for half day Friday and all day on Monday.

Thanks!

JMF"

I just deleted the External demand charge on deal 233091.  I wonder if there 
should be an Internal demand charge for $.09?

Shawna,
I am Isabel and I work in Gas Settlements.  Could you help me out with the 
following?

Deal # 233091 for Bay State is charging a demand charge every month.  
Accourding to Bay State Enron should not be charging demand charges.  Could 
you let me know if this correct.  Should Enron be charging demand charges?  
Maureen Smith is down as the trader on the deal.  However, I am not sure if 
that is correct.  Please let me know if you are not the correct person to 
send this note too.  
Thank you for your help!

Went VERY well.  Lots of positive vibes afterwards and goodwill towards both of you.  People most appreciated executives admitting to the fact that things were wrong and they were frustrated too, but everyone needs to get over it.  Big change from past history of blaming everyone but ourselves and just glossing over the real problems and making them sound better....

Kim,

Talked to Earl Chanley and he stated that we(TW) would have to get a lease agreement with Questar to install TW facilities on their land.  Earl said R-O-W team would handle.  I'm coping Mansoor to keep him informed.  He is the project manager over this project.  I assume this project has not been released for construction or a restricted release to obtain materials (ie; long-lead items) or right of way.

Please advise if you would need any assistance in distributing the communications. Additionally, can you please confirm your approval to migrate the changes into production on Friday.

Thanks

		 Subject: Alberta Pool Rule Changes

Unfortunately, today in an unprecedented move the Alberta Government 
over-ruled the Power Pool on its decision yesterday not to amend the Power 
Pool Rules and exclude importers from setting pool price.  The Minister 
signed a regulation under the Electric Utilities Act that excludes imports 
from influencing the determination of the pool price.   The Power Pool has 
been tasked to work out the mechanics of implementing the regulation.  Larry 
Charach advised that this move was made by the politicians in the face of 
advice not to do it from Larry.   Apparently the Premier met with 
representatives of Alberta farmers yesterday and also learned of what the 
Government considers to be excessive pricing being offered by  Enmax (the 
City of Calgary owned retailer) that included: 1 Year (on-peak) $190/Mwh Cdn, 
1 Year (all-hours) $137/Mwh Cdn.   

Peter Keohane and I have a meeting tomorrow morning with lawyers from 
Blakes.  The present thinking is that we need to get legal advice on whether 
we need to   send a letter to the Government indicating that Enron believes 
this action to be contrary to the provisions of the EUA prior to our 
participating in the MAP Auction on Monday and Tuesday.  The fear is that our 
conduct of pursuing new commercial opportunities in this market may somehow 
estop us from later arguing the new regulation is ultra vires the EUA.   
Notwithstanding the advice we get on this point, there is agreement here 
(Milnthorp and Keohane) that if we do send a letter it must not include a 
paragraph threatening to sue the Alberta Government. 

Regards,

Rob"

We want to know what you think.

We all know that communication is one of Enron's core values.   We have 
introduced several new communication tools in the last year, like eThink and 
eBiz, that complement our more traditional methods of communicating, such as 
Enron Business (print and online) and face-to-face meetings.

The internal communications team would like you to take a few minutes and 
complete the following survey about the communication tools you find most 
effective.  Please give us your honest feedback about the tools and methods 
you use most often -- and tell us about the ones you don't use or need.

We appreciate your time.  Your feedback will help us tailor our communication 
efforts to better meet your needs.

Kay:

We have attached execution copies of the following documents for execution
by GE:

1.  GE Letter re Forms of Agreement;
2.  GE Consent and Agreement;
3.  Legal Opinion of Counsel to GE;
4.  GE Receipt.

These documents were circulated by Isabel Parker to Kent Shoemaker, you, me
and others on April 23, 2001.

The only other document is the GE Parent Guaranty.  Greg Lang circulated
comments (in a PDF file) by an e-mail 4/18 at 5:59 p.m.   Greg asked earlier
today whether the form of this document had been agreed by GE and I could
not respond.

You should have the following documents:

1.  Assignment and Assumption Agreement; and
2.  Turbine Contract.

Several of the ENA documents are not yet finalized, so I will try to get
those to you after lunch.  Please send over the LLC certificate book in
order that we may prepare membership certificates.

If you have any questions or comments, please advise.  Thanks.

Attached are the responses to the questions of FERC staff about EOL resulting 
from their visit earlier this month.  I have used the revisions from Louise 
and incorporated comments from Bob Butts about the value at risk discussion.  
Mark Haedicke has reviewed this draft.  I would like to send these to Kim 
Bruno at FERC later today.

An additional FYI.  Connie Lausten of the U.S. House Government Reform 
Committee made a request to Enron's DC office to see the trading floor 
operations in addition to holding a discussion about Enron Online.  She is to 
meet with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor on Friday, July 13th at 9am.  John 
Shelk from our DC office told me when people on the Hill say ""Enron OnLine"" 
they mean not only the online trading platform itself, but the broader 
subject of financial products and energy  trading, whether online or 
otherwise.  John said that the interest coming from the Hill is broader than 
the platform alone and reflects in many ways a lack of understanding of the 
benefits of what we do in this area.  We will be coordinating this with the 
DC office.  

Please call me with any comments at 37007."

Per your request for year-to-date numbers: here's an example of what I could 
include in the daily EOL summary. Let me know if this is helpful for you, and 
if you'd like it included on the graph sheet. I think it might be too tight 
to fit on the page as it is, but there's no reason why we can't generate a 
two-page report. As long as we're going in that direction, is ther any other 
data you'd like to see in graph form?

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Chrissy,  This is Cove Point gas we use to cover CES retail sales on TCO.  
The price was not entered in the separate meter entry for COVE POINT for that 
deal #143336.  So I entered the CGAS APPAL.IF.MI + 0.0841 price to cover 
those sales to CES. FYI.. It's the same price we have for all the other 
retail sales to CES on TCO on that ticket.   If it is different then change 
it.  THANKS

Chris,

Just wanted to verify a portion of sitara # 143336 (Sale to Columbia Energy 
Services Corp.).

At the point, ""Loudoun - CGAS/CVPT Loudoun"", volumes are coming through Unify 
@ $0 and Econ is flashing volumes @ $ .0001. I just wanted to make certain 
that the economics  pricing is correct since all other parts of the deal are 
at  an Index + .0841.

Please call or e-mail your response. 

Thanks for your help.

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under ""SEC Filings.""

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=

In your presentation today you mentioned an assessment agreement and an 
interconnection agreement.  Roger says he isn't working on it.  Who in Legal 
is handling those docs?

Does this apply only to the North American contracts and weather trades for 
which you are responsible?  
Does the instruction below apply to Australia and Japan ISDA's?

Subject: Online Weather Trading

Per my conversations with Mark Taylor, we should continue to put any weather 
trades done online under any relevant master agreement with the 
counterparty.  Further, there is no prohibition against doing a trade online 
with a counterparty when we do not have a master in place.  Any non-master 
trades would go under the respective GTC.  It appears to be only a 
coincidence that we are trading online only with counterparties we have 
masters in place with.

A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
 
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  

I.	During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.	After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.

Thanks to all of you who have commented already on earlier versions of the 
attached white paper.  Remember, this is the message we want to use now as we 
are telling various audiences our strategy for the regions.  Please edit on e 
mail and send comments back to me by end of day London time Wednesday if 
possible.  I am en route to Houston on Wednesday.

I am also recruiting Frank Sayre to help me with the Central America section, 
which is weak.

Once I hear from you I'll revise again and send new draft by Thursday.  Who 
should be on the next distribution list besides all of you?

Sara, sorry I missed your call yesterday morning.

If you were able to meet yesterday to discuss Buy Side Direct and Trading 
Edge, could I get an update from either of you ?  If you have not met, I am 
available to join your discussion at any time.

Thanks.

I am in complete agreement with you..this was for a total of $150 and was 
given at the request of a powerful woman senator, who is the sponsor of this 
program..if it had been for more money I would have not have contributed, but 
the 17 women members that were there are of importance to us.

Meredith, I see both of the Bay States deals in Unify on the 31st.  I 
remember chatting with deal clearing about it yesterday.  Could you path 
those deals and email Mark when you are done.

Mark, I'm expecting you to see the amount of the invoice come across in Unify 
after Meredith paths the gas.  Just a note, we will probably be billed 
interest because the payment is late.  I think it was due on 2/26/2000."

Eric, as per my discussion with Rob, I believe that the site has the most 
value to us given its location and capability.  I would continue to actively 
develop that site for a variety of turbine technologies.  As far as the 
turbines, I would probably exit them in the most opportune manner.

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com."

J -- I just talked to our team at Marathon and they're really jazzed about 
next Tuesday's meeting.  They're really looking to identify ways that they 
can add to our strategy -- politically and publicly -- so they'll likely come 
up with a plan with some recommendations after the meeting.

One thing we were supposed to send to them (which I forgot) was the Luntz 
survey.  I don't think I ever saw it.  Do you have a copy?  Could you forward 
to me and I'll send on?

Thanks -- you're the best!

Mary,
 I see that Phil Bair from JWorthan has responded to Phil DeMoes concerning 
the bond term.  No comments were made concerning the legal opinion for the 
legal counsel for the bond provider.  I was going to suggest that the 
contract language be modified to provide that the Company had a reasonable 
amount of time at the end of the lst 5 yr bond term to provide a substitute 
bond for the remaining term and that if the Company was able to get a 
replacement bond in place before the expiration of such period, no default 
would occur.  Can you tell from the letter that Phil Bair is proposing if 
their are any other issues that either ENRON or the Bond Provider would have 
concerning the terms of the Bond and the Customer's methods of getting 
funding thereunder.

Dan,

Take a look at this letter prepared by our surety provider on the PEAK 
pre-pay.  In particular, note the last paragraph.  I'm concerned on the 
unwind if there is a default.   We plan to meet tomorrow with Joe Deffner and 
Breese tomorrow morning.  Are you available?

Subject: PEAK Surety Reference Letter


Phil-Attached is a first round draft of a reference letter for the PEAK 
project.  Please review and let me know what changes are suggested.

I've made calls to several of the major sureties this morning to re-confirm 
the availability of long term/non-cancellable bonds.  Five years is the 
general ceiling.  We need to be careful  PEAK understands that if the surety 
elects not to renew at the end of the first five years, this does not trigger 
an automatic demand against the bond.  PEAK should already know the issues 
involved from the surety side based on previous negotiations they had with 
other energy marketers when this project was negotiated (without success) 
last fall.  This is not an Enron issue-it goes to commercial availability.

Call me with your comments.  Thanks.

Dear Steve, 

I attach a draft paper for the purposes of Steve's presention and subsequent 
submission to the ITC which address reforms in the Australian electricity 
sector. 

As you are probably aware, Enron Australia does not operate in the New 
Zealand market and so the above report does not cover NZ as we are not really 
in a position to provide useful comment on that market.  However, I was able 
to locate a NZ Ministerial inquiry into the electricity industry which, if 
Steve chooses to comment on NZ, may be of use to you.  A copy of that report 
is attached.


Regards,
Rob.

Ken,

I mentionned to Jeff that it would be cool if we could have a 363 (ENE) area 
code for Houston he thinks its a great idea.
We need to lobby do you have any desire to help?

I know that in the overall scheme of things this is really not important but 
I think that this should be followed up.

Let me know what you think

Philippe,

Here is an outline of the 363 numbering information we talked about, the 
process is very complicated and may need us to set down with the senior 
management to explain how it works and the implications, my suggestion is 
that Ken Rice would be the best one to take it forward, as he understands the 
market and has some profile as the head of a bandwidth / telecoms company

Tony Alvarado is the lead for this one, his extension is 37801 let me know 
how you want to proceed

Just an update for you and a question.  First, I have talked to Christie
and corresponded via e-mail.  We don't have dates to talk to Lay, Skilling
and Fastow as yet but Christie is working on it.  I will prompt her again
next week.

The second item of business is a question.  I want to see if we can move
our meeting in Spring (Business education and the new economy workshop)
back a week to Friday February 23rd.  One of the attendees has a conference
he wants to attend on March 2nd.  Let me know asap if the 23rd works for
you.  I have committments from a number of folks for the workshop and I
think it will be great fun and a wonderful learning experience for us all.

USGT
Sold 20,000 MMBtu/d of Daily Firm space moving gas for the weekend from PG&E 
Topock to SoCal Needles at $.10/MMBtu.  This was somewhat of a novel deal in 
that the California price spreads opened up and gas became trapped at PG&E.  
Once our station 4 compressor becomes fully operational, this opportunity 
will likely dry up.  

Enron N.A.
Representatives contacted us this week to discuss our possible participation 
in a gas storage field using a depleted reservoir on Navajo land near 
Farmington, NM.  Third party developers approached ENA looking for assistance 
in moving the project forward.

New Tariff Services
Marketing consensus was reached to delay any further development of 
Transwestern's Hourly Firm Service until the potential markets of power plant 
loads become operational.  During this interim period, Park 'n Ride services 
provided on an intra-day basis shall be priced incrementally higher than Park 
'n Ride services provided on a timely basis.  Any resulting market response 
will provide indications of market willingness to pay premium transport rates 
for hourly transportation service.

El Paso 
El Paso Merchant Services needs to re-scrub their verbal offer to 
Transwestern of a $15 Million lump sum ""pre-payment"" option of fuel 
monetization for their combined 65,000 MMBtu/d of San Juan to California 
capacity.  El Paso did not take into consideration the different termination 
dates of the two contracts (25,000 MMBtu/d PG&E permanent release contract, 
and 40,000 MMBtu/d Gallup expansion contract) in their analysis.  A revised 
proposed lump sum payment offer is expected mid-next week.

El Paso Field Services
Met with EP representatives to discuss a possible interconnect near WT-1.  
The I/C would be sized for 40,000 MMBtu/d.  EP proposes to pay for and set 
compression to flow this gas into our high pressure line and has agreed to a 
volume commitment of 20,000 MMBtu/d for up to 2 years.  An added advantage is 
most of the volume would come from the constrained Atoka area which would 
allow Agave to increase deliveries to TW.

Caithness Corp.
Caithness has decided to move forward on their 1000 Mw generation project in 
Northwest Arizona.  The 2-phase project would initially consume 80,000 
MMBtu/d of gas.  The proposed location is 40 miles south of TW's line near 
Wickieup, AZ.  We are meeting with Caithness reps next week.  Projected 
in-service date for the plant is early 2002.

WT-2 Cooler Expansion
Level B cost estimates are being prepared.  Revenue / cost savings 
assumptions predict $500,000 annual revenue to support the expenditure.  Once 
installed, the project would give TW an additional 50,000 MMBtu/d capacity on 
the east end.  Financial evaluations will be done once the cost estimate is 
received.

NGPL Winkler Interconnect
NGPL notified us this week the reactivated point should be operationally 
ready to flow gas on July 17 (about 2 weeks ahead of schedule).  This will 
hopefully provide new system supply to TW's east end of about 80 - 
90,000/MMBtu/d.

Subject: Desert Sky Curtailment April 2002

Kurt,
I have attached the April Log with some corrections to the curtailments.  The 
lines I shaded blue are typing errors that I fixed.  These will account for 
the negative hours and the turbines with no data. 

 The turbines that are showing hours but no production must be a result of a 
SCADA data acquisition problem.  These entries I shaded in red.  I started 
looking through the list in the April Log but I could not find any errors on 
our side, so you may have to base the lost production on what a particular 
turbines' neighbor produced or lost.  

Call me if you have any questions.

Matt,
Please take a look at this as soon as possible this morning. It appears that 
you may have some entries where the operator used the 12 hour clock instead 
of th 24 hour clock. There are many rows where a turbine is curtailed but the 
way the time is recorded makes it come out with zero production. Call me if 
you need help.

Subject: Desert Sky Curtailment April 2002

Kurt,

I'm attaching the generated spreadsheet. There are a few problems. Scanning 
through it it appears the site personnel entered some times backwards so 
there were a few negative durations with 0 kWh predicted productions. I also 
do not know what is causing the other 0 kWh productions (it might be low 
wind, or there might be some other problem).

There was a 90.9% data recovery. The predicted production for the month was 
45929604 kWh, the production lost due to curtailment was 21780739 kWh which 
after 97% availability and 2% line loss becomes 20704770 kWh.

Due to the many curtailments at the site this program takes a lot of time 
(today it ran for 2 hours). 

Mark

Importance:	High

Louise Kitchen/John Lavorato have requested that each of you prepare a brief one page summary highlighting your accomplishments for this review period by end of day Friday, June 29, 2001.  

You may use the PEP system and do a self-evaluation (let me know if you need assistance w/this) or send me an email bullet pointing your accomplishments.  If you have already done a self-eval, you do not need to respond to this email.  HR is compiling the information for OOTC and I appreciate your assistance/timely response.  I apologize for the quick turn around-just got the request myself.

Please call or email w/any questions.  Thanks.

This list looks much better than the other one.  Please make sure that we are 
clear with the FERC people that this is a list of AA projects related to CWIP 
and not a list of everything under the sun that AA does for us.  I want to 
avoid any appearance that we misled the FERC people.  Thanks. DF

Thank you for keeping me in the loop on your activities.  While I am always supportive of more public statements pushing competition, neither I nor Enron can sign on to the letter.  

First, I am concerned that having Enron sign on will distract from your messages.  Enron is a ""hot button"" in DC and will change the proper focus.

In addition, I would argue that the recommendation for a national commission is out of place with the current timing of FERC and Congressional action -- which is imminent -- while a commission would delay action on the Hill and at FERC, thus supporting the forces against competition.  Let's not study this too much - we know what to do.  Move away from the commission.

Also, I'm not sure how providing federal grant money only to states that promote competition supports our efforts.  Making GA pay for PA is a distraction from the main fights at FERC and on the Hill.

Finally, I would guess that more funds to FERC and other agencies will only be used to increase enforcement against those in the industry.  While Enron wants markets that work well, the core problem is that we haven't deregulated enough - not that markets aren't working. 

Also, I don't know where the recommendation numbers from the Bush/Cheney plan came from -- I think it was an earlier document -- there are no such numbers in the final printed version of the report that I have.

If you want to talk, please let me know.

Thanks,

Jim"

Sara,

An Interest Rate swap was entered into with the above counterparty in October 
1997.  This was part of a large structured Coal deal.  (Coal Capital Co.?)  I 
believe the confirm was created in Legal.   Is it possible for me to get a 
copy of this confirmation?  We are having a real problem getting this 
settlement booked each month, so we want to refer to confirm to see what is 
said.  I am out next week, but could you ask someone to send a copy to Todd 
Warwick?  he is in ENA reporting and is helping me out with this.  Thanks. "

Subject: Pros & Cons of EES Filing Testimony in Rate Case

Jay --

I wanted to talk with first thing on Friday about our decision to weigh in 
with testimony in this case.  Forgetting the question Legal may or may not 
have (let's assume they don't have any concerns) about Scott testifying, it 
is still my opinion that we should not file testimony. I will adjust my 
schedule to meet with you.

First, I assume that you have already marked your book to the Lynch 
""thoughts"" on rate design and revenue allocation included in the initial 
Order.   I make this assumption, because the loss to EES has already occurred 
and our goal now is to try and bring back some of the value by (a) focusing 
on revenue sharing and (b) rate design.  Scott indicates that the loss could 
be $100MM with bad outcomes on the 2 key issues.  My purpose of EES' activity 
is to try and minimize that number.  I feel that a quiet but forceful role in 
the case is the best vehicle given our recent troubles in CA and before the 
CPUC.  We have a reserve set aside for the actual outcome of the rate case.

Second, I am not sure that Govt Affairs is comfortable with Scott's model of 
rate design.  While tiering of rates is on the table, the question of demand 
reduction payback under his framework could result in customers using 70% of 
their load and paying nothing.  That hardly makes sense.  Now maybe we just 
don't understand, but putting in testimony that is unclear or confusing isn't 
going to win the day before the CPUC.  When we talk with you this morning, we 
should be able to get you comfortable.  If we cannot agree, then we should 
sit down with Don and Janet. 

Third, most of our victory will come from aligning with the big users.  If we 
are supporting / defending our own testimony (which they haven't seen), I 
think that our ability to work through a Settlement will be limited.  Our 
goal is to ""pick and choose"" from the best solutions proposed while trying to 
highlight other options through cross-examination (granted, this may be very 
hard).   We should have a list of the best to worst outcomes for Enron and 
should work to get the best possible outcome. 

Fourth, someone may try to get EES to weigh in on the allocation of these 
costs to DA customers.  We have agreed not to take on that issue.  Scott 
doesn't get to use the Fifth Amendment to not answer. Let's discuss strategy

Scott and his team is preparing testimony.  Give me a call.  If Scott and you 
are intent on moving forward, we'll do as you see fit within the other 
constraints. 

Jim

Subject: pros and cons

Here is the list of pros and cons for Scott Stoness filing testimony in the 
CPUC rate design case (testimony due tomorrow, hearing set to begin next 
Monday).  We have a call into Mike Smith to get legal's view.

Pros of filing testimony:

Getting out on the table a demand reduction program and a market-based 
pricing mechanism

Favorable ""strawman"" proposal can move direction of CPUC decision in our favor

Insurance policy in case no one files a proposal we like

Can be withdrawn before hearing if we have other proposals we can support

Could give us leverage to participate in settlement negotiations 

Easier to make case through direct testimony than on cross exam.

Cons of filing testimony:

We get in a position of having to defend our position and loose ability to 
throw support behind other positive proposals (alone or in combination) 

We open ourselves to cross examlination and discovery  (Scott Stoness will be 
supporting witness and could have information we would not want revealed).

Enron is not very popular these days and filing/testimony could fuel more 
negative press

Additional Enron resources will be used (Scott's time, Tamara's time)

Market dysfunction may help ENA's position



Scott Stoness estimates that there is a $50 million risk if dollars are not 
apportioned properly to each rate class, but this is an issue that a number 
of parties will likely be addressing in their testimony.  He estimates that 
there is an additional $50 million at risk if CPUC's seasonal rate design is 
adopted as opposed to his two-part real time pricing proposal.  $100 million 
potential loss if Lynch proposal does not solve the problem for the winter of 
2001-2002 and anothe rate increase is needed in November.

I just received a call from GE (Jeff Darst and Steve Swift) in which they said that NorthWestern was asking for GE to sign documents that would enable NorthWestern to buy out Enron remaining interest in the LLC.  I am unaware of any discussions with NorthWestern with regards to this.  Please give me a call, and be advised that Jeff and Steve are going to call you.

...the third time is a charm.  After 2 failed adoptions, God has blessed me 
with a beautiful daughter!  Emily Lyn was born on Saturday, July 8 at 11:18 
am in San Antonio.  She weighed 7 lbs. and measured 19 inches.  She is so 
tiny and has a head full of dark hair!  I brought her home last night at 8:30 
pm.  Our first 
night went well even if I didn't get any sleep.  It's going to take some time 
for me to get used to the noises she makes.  I must admit, there were
days when I never thought this would happen.  I appreciate all the kind words 
of encouragement many of you have shared over the last few years
as I have gone through this process, especially during the really low 
points.  I am truly blessed.
I will be out of the office for a while but feel free to stay in touch as I'm 
sure I'll be logging in often.  Also, if I left someone off the list here, 
please have them forgive me.  Remember, I'm working on 0 sleep.  Please feel 
free to pass this along to anyone I may have fogotten.  Thanks.

Everybody,

Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline 
call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to 
know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of 
Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they 
were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for 
Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the 
status of the master.

Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know 
if any of you know anything about this, because I had no idea who to direct 
his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling 
this and pass the info on."

It is with regret that I have to announce that Jeff Skilling is leaving Enron.  Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.
Now it's time to look forward.
With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.
On Thursday at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, we will hold an all employee meeting at the Hyatt.  We will broadcast the meeting to our employees around the world where technically available, and I look forward to seeing many of you there."

We may have been overtaken by events - I spoke to Sally today on this, GCP

Apologies for the cancelled meeting - I wanted Steve to be there and he is

Subject: Global Rates

I thought I would share with you my ideas in regard to my upcoming trip to 
London.

I would like to meet with you and James New for about an hour when I first 
arrive to get a feel of your businesses and to give both of you an update on 
the new and improved Global Rates Group.   I would also appreciate it if I 
could unobtrusively sit with several of your risk groups in order to among 
other things, get an idea of the types of commodities London trades and their 
respective Exchanges and to become familiar with the current process that 
London uses to capture commodity rates.  

After a couple of days, I am confident that I could have an idea of how 
Global Rates could be of the most benefit to London.

This trip would of course be charged to the Global Rates CC and not allocated 
back to London, since it is a ""discovery""  trip, which we have budgeted for 
in our 2001 budget.

I wouldn't want this to interfere in anyway with your ongoing business, 
therefore would you please let me know when you and James would be in London 
during the next couple of  weeks and I will schedule my trip accordingly.

Thanks again for your assistance, it is unfortunate that our teleconference 
scheduled for today got cancelled.

where've we been?  where've you been?  really only stay at my house on
school nites (monday/thursday). will be chez toi tonite.  would LOVE to go
back this weekend (it's gorgeous---TONS of iris, apple blossoms, wild
flowers, etc.), but alas, we promised you're folks we'd plant tomatoes this
weekend.  I'm going to put down nice gravely rock around the beds, so it
looks more like Italy, or France or something and we don't get all the
weeds.  Sorry about S.D., but it will be super nice down there.  Be sure to
go to Black's Beach.  And golf and Torrey Pines.  See you tonite?

You and I can discuss the agency agreement, then get them on the line.

You know, I must have received your message on Tuesday because I remember 
reading it - but I can't find it in my computer.  Can you resend so I'll have 
the dates?  My guess is you shouldn't arrange space for me.  If I can get

sure I'll find a room somewhere close by.

Allan,

I shall be glad to meet you. I am planning to attend the Energy Symposium
and we can meet on the location. If business keeps me at the office,
feel free to contact me at 713 853 3848 and we can schedule a meeting during 
the day 
or in the evening.

Vince

Subject: Visit to Houston




Vince,

I hope things are well with you and your family.

The reason for contacting you today is to let you know I will be in Houston 
next
week between Monday and Wednesday inclusive.  If there is an opportunity to 
meet
up, probably informally, it would be useful to discuss our continuing 
activities
in the areas of Strategy, Value and, increasingly, Real Options.

If you are attending our Energy Symposium, or can meet up, please contact me 
at
your convenience.  If we do meet, I would also like to introduce you to one of
our senior managers from Houston:  George E. Danner.  George is a member of 
our
US National Strategy team and part of our global network of specialists 
working
on real option pricing.

If I do not speak to you before tomorrow - happy Thanksgiving.

ALLAN

I'm concerned about the 2nd bullet.  We've been taking the position that we don't want this ""payment of PX credit"" issue in this proceeding -- the ""free-for-all"" proceeding. Have we changed our position?  If not, I am concerned that Edison will either state directly or give the impression that it's part of the Barnett proceeding.

Subject:	RE: Call Regarding Prehearing Conference on Our Negative CTC complaint

OK.  Haven't heard back from Bob, but we may be able to avoid the call.  Mike Day got in touch with Edison's attorney this morning and here's the end result.

Edison has agreed to tell the judge on the 7th that, with respect to the complaints we've filed, they agree to take them off calendar until and unless parties ask to put them back on calendar.
Edison will  take the view that the proceedings underway at the commission (and presumably attempts to ""settle"" with parties) will resolve the issues in the complaint.
The assumption from out end is that the status quo remains intact.  That is, we will continue to pay the Commission, not Edison, for T&D charges during the ""time out"" on our complaints.  
Mike and Jeanne will make sure that this critical piece, i.e., that we continue to place payments in escrow, will remain intact as part of the ""time out.""  If it turns out there are any doubts about this aspect, we'll likely need regroup and reconsider our options.

If anyone has any questions or concerns please speak up, and/or if folks would still like to have a very brief call to discuss, we can do that and ensure that Bob is kept in the loop and can weigh in when he returns.

Comments/thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

ECT and Sonoco entered into a one- year ""plastics"" swap which terminated on 
March 31, 1999.  Doug Friedman (plastics trader) has asked that ECT formally 
demand $60,000 from Sonoco for underpayment on the swap.  Sonoco has claimed 
the existence of a Market Disruption resulting from price reformation in the 
plastics publication ""Monthly Petrochemical & Pleastics Analysis"" which 
caused it to use a differenct Floating Price calculation.  ECT disagrees as 
to the existence of such an event.  Doug will contact me this week to review 
our approach.  Please give me a call.  Thanks.  Sara

Currently, Kroum is fixing the problem.

Please note that the forward obligations report will now read from the 
Scheduling Tables rather than the Deal Entry Tables whenever scheduling data 
exists.  Please forward this e-mail this to other individuals in your groups 
who use this report.  The data was tested by the Portland office, if you 
notice problems with the report please refer your questions to Kroum Kroumov 
or Duong Luu.

I've tested the ""schedule"" version of forward obs.  It seems to be working 
well.  

The wish list might include a summary page to show the desks net 0. And it 
could use a default that pulls all the west desks when the West portfolio is 
clicked, while retaining the flexibility of overriding the west default to 
choose individual desks - HOWEVER - it does work fine the way it is.

Please release this to production and let Fran Chang, Heather Dunton, 
Samantha Law and Diana Scholtes know when it is released.  Thanks!

Tom , I appreciate the e-mail - sorry for the delay in response.

I am on-side with all your points.  On the New Albany retrofit, I want to 
ensure that I am not replacing one patent problem with another so a clear 
""title"" up front on the new equipment will be important.  However, I will be 
interested in hearing your solution especially if it can further reduce NOX 
and increase our operating hours.

I share your interest in the FT-4 project hopefully we can take that to the 
next level.

Please stay in contact.

Regards

Dave,

Thank you for taking the time to discuss the issues and opportunities facing
our companies. I did not expect to have such an audience. I came seeking
business advice on the litigation and feel I accomplished a lot more. I
apologize for not contacting you directly, but I was unaware that you were
now responsible for all of the groups within ENA.   Congratulations !!!!!

Here is what I came away with:

Litigation
GE has proposed a settlement that includes a proposed press release
unacceptable to PSM. I have our attorneys working on drafting a response to
GE and pursing the possibility of eliminating the joint press release
altogether. If common ground cannot be reached we will pursue other legal
options.

Private Placement
The book has been released to Enron & Calpine. I understand your position
concerning participation and the question of the ongoing litigation. I am
very open to the additional warrant option. Mike Miller talked to me about
it after the meeting and we will discuss it next week.

New Albany Retrofit
I have asked my engineers to formulate a plan to upgrade the units at New
Albany with our latest 6 ppm liners and fuel nozzles. We are currently
manufacturing a full set for a 7EA machine. We haven't firmed up the test
dates but we need to seek approval by ENA & OEC to use one of the Doyle
machines. This is a significant leap in technology that many of our clients
are extremely interested in. We now have the only single digit dry low Nox
system that can be used on multiple machine types to include Westinghouse
501D5A, ABB 11 N1/N2, GE F6 / F7.

FT4 Mobile Unit
I understand from Mike Miller you want to slow the pace down on the first
ten units to ""Learn out"" the manufacturing and business process. This will
ease our pain level on schedule. My engineering staff is very excited with
this program because it involves aircraft engines and they can apply their
true skills. We just hired the program manager named George Kirsby. He is
currently in charge of the $4 billion Joint Strike Fighter engine design
program for Pratt Whitney / Boeing. I figure he should be able to manage the
mobile unit project. At some time in the near future I would like to arrange
a program presentation for you in Houston. I need to give Kirsby a few weeks
to get his arms around the project and will propose dates for you in the
future. We need to expedite the formation of the Joint Venture company as we
are already being approached with deals to place these units.

I really value your support and you can always count on our loyalty to
Enron.

I like to make my own chili.  I load it up with beans, Sue uses pork and
beans(it's O.K.), but I like the beans mom used to use.    I was told I needed
to put a little more kick into my chili, so I figured that I would ask the
best-JOE.

Hey, for Christmas, I will provide the Ham and all the beer,wine,pop,liquor,
pie,chips , nuts and bread. I will have Amy make some barbacued weiners. I will
need you to make double baked potatoes. I will have Jean bring the polish
sausage and corn/greenbeans.  I may get some sourerkraut and dumplins from
Stoysich also.  I will tell dad that he can pay for the ham.
I will have Joey bring a relish trey  and some lasagne.( I thought it was
pretty good)
Do we need anything else? We are all off on that day, so we can start the party
as early as 3P.M. or earlier if you think, my guess is that you will be at the
casino that morning. Please advise.

Hi!=20

         Sorry it has taken so long to respond but I took a few days of vac=
ation.  Happy New Year to you too and I hope it is a better year for all of=
 us.  Today they announced that UBS Warburg has purchased the trading compa=
ny.  This is good news except we do not know any information about how the =
company will be structured so I still do not know if I will have a job.  Th=
is is stressful because it has been going on for so long.  I wish something=
 would happen good or bad.  Originally I thought this would be a terrible t=
hing to not have a job at Enron or in the energy sector but as time goes on=
 I have come to think maybe it would just force us to do something else wit=
h our lives.  Something we have thought about for a long time. It is a trag=
edy that after 25 years of service we will get no severance.  I feel so sad=
 for all those people who lost everything including a job.  Dick has been r=
etained as a key employee for EES to help close down the business so his jo=
b will eventually end.  We have no time frame for him.  Hope everything is =
going well for you and your family.  Take care!

All:

Attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  These seats are located on the 30th and 31st Floors of Enron Center North (ECN).  As previously communicated, you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ECS.

The exception to this is as follows:
If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This will hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st floor seats set up at that time.

Testing:
Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, you will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6pm.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.

If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel free to contact me at any time.

1.  Clean copy of Canadianized EEI base contract
2.  Copy of the Candianized EEI base contract, blacklined to show the changes 
to the US form
3.  Canadianized schedules to the EEI contract, including only the three 
products previously included in the industrial power master
4.  Form of EEI Cover Sheet, including the porposed changes to the Canadian 
form of base contract that Enron Canada would include as part thereof

I will develop over the next while a set of situation specific riders that 
Enron Canada can use, similar to those riders developed by ENA.

Please provide me with any comments you may have with respect to these 
documents.  I understand that Chris has a fair amount of pressure on him to 
table our proposed form of the Canadianized EEI documents to the Ontario 
drafting group before their next meeting on November 22.

Hey, what happened to those docs that you said had to be fed exd to Legner?  
I've written his address and put it in my red book for the temporary in case 
you need her to send them out.  I've also got an extra copy of his address 
for me just in case we need it.  Just thought I'd let you know.

Subject: So Cal Edison Claims Withholding of Pipeline Capacity  

Jeff,
Is it possible for TW to get a copy of the Edison filing at the CPUC?  While 
the article [shown below] doesn't provide any details, I suspect Edison's 
complaint echoes earlier allegations against El Paso regarding their sale of 
the 1.2 Bcf/d block of capacity to their affiliate.  I don't think 
Transwestern and/or Enron affiliate marketing companies are implicated in 
this deal at all.  

Can you confirm this is an ""El Paso only"" problem and not something Enron is 
being drawn into?  I really appreciate your help here.

Please get copies to me asap of the Edison motion and the CPUC FERC

and I'll have her itemize any allegations we might want to repond to.

Edison Charges Gas Market Manipulation

Southern California Edison filed a motion late last week with the California 
Public Utility Commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices 
on which its power purchase rates are based. The company told the CPUC that 
Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen 
by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the 
withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the 
supply basins and the California border. 

""[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential 
has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, 
collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and 
merchants,"" Edison told the CPUC. 

The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC 
regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of ""certain allegedly 
collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas 
suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas 
prices by wrongfully withholding capacity."" It notes the complaint 
""conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis 
differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100 
million annually since the beginning of 1998."" 

Edison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of 
$4.5133/MMBtu, which was applied to SCE's August 2000 avoided cost posting, 
to calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for the 
month of October and every month going forward. It estimated September 
bidweek border prices would average $7/MMBtu. If such prices were used in 
Edison's September avoided costs posting, its Transition Formula payments to 
certain independent power producers will be $29 million more than the month 
prior, the company told the CPUC. ""No mechanism exists to recapture the 
increase in such payments if it is later determined by this commission or in 
another forum that the Topock border indices are unreliable at this time.""

You are not going to tell John that you can't make dinner.  You need to go.  I can't stay out that long anyway, but I am planning on leaving early.  Why are you torturing yourself by reading that e-mail?  A tubby?  Is that what you call a bath?  Cute.  It doesn't bother me to talk to you about anything.  You can talk to me anytime.  Studying?  Are you kidding, I just got home and I am not motivated at all.  I think that I am kidding myself about trying to go to school.  I don't want to do anything but sit on the couch.  I have gotten so lazy.  That is why I am going to start playing soccer again in January.  You can make fun of me if you want to.  Cheer up.

Maybe the City can be called out to fix ALL of the curbs and gutters on 
Welch, when they do the street patch on Welch.  It is a tragedy that COH 
never does a job well.  At least I have some satisfaction that Annise's 
crumbling curb wasn't replaced either.  Oh, forgive me, perhaps it wasn't 
really in need of repair!

Bob and Sarah,

Further to our conversation on Wednesday night, we have identified the top 10-15 counterparties from both a terminated and non-terminated perspective that we want to begin working on.  Of the non-terminated, 6 are counterparties that should be sent demand letters.

Shari Mao will be providing you today a list of those counterparties that owe us money and should be sent demand letters.  Lynn Shivers will be pulling these contracts as well as those for the overall top 10 to 15 and we will begin the binder process and get you copies of the contracts as soon as possible.  We will also do the credit agg check for collateral and any overlap with other commodities.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Things should be back to normal on Friday.  You will be able to start

Subject:	Logistics Commercial Realignment


After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

As you know, the mid year PRC process is underway.  The system ""officially"" 
closed for feedback last Friday, 6/1.  The system will remain usable by 
supervisors until the PRC process has completed.  Below is a schedule of 
other dates that you should be aware of:

6/18  EGM Commercial Support PRC Meeting
6/19  EGM Trading PRC Meeting
6/20  EGM Origination PRC Meeting

6/25  Associate and Analyst PRC Meeting

7/10  EWS Final PRC Meeting
(In this meeting, Mgr and above will be cross-calibrated for all of EWS.  
Below Mgr, the curves for each job group will be reviewed at the business 
unit level and then overall for EWS.  At the end of this meeting, there will 
be a pre-PRC for VP's in preparation for the 7/23 meeting.)
 
7/23 & 7/24 Executive Committee PRC
  (In this meeting, VP's and MD's will be rated relative to their peers 
across Enron.)

A few side notes:

? Please make sure your employees have completed a self-evaluation.  The 
""accomplishments"" section of this evaluation is viewable in the PRC meeting 
in which the employee is reviewed.  (As of today, the system will still allow 
employees to complete the self-evaluation.)
? 
? As you are preparing to represent employees in a PRC meeting, be aware that 
the consolidated feedback and self-evaluation are printable.
? 
? Lastly, if you will be asking any of your direct reports to attend one of 
the EGM meetings on 6/19-6/20, please let me know asap.  I must provide a 
complete list of meeting participants before we are able to conduct the 
meeting.  (Pls. err on the side of less rather than more people while 
ensuring that employees receive fair representation).

Please call me (ext. 59386) or Khymberly Booth (ext. 36019) should you have 
any additional questions."

John Sherriff has asked me to update you on the status of our relationship 
with EnCom, as well as what I am doing to develop a plan for the way forward 
with our investment.

Background

As you may be aware, Enron made its investment in EnCom in October 1999.  
Bruce Wrobel is President/CEO.  Our current cumulative investment is now 
$34,750,000.  We own 63.80 %, and have the right to put 5 members on a board 
of nine.  There are two other strategic, Japanese investors in the business; 
Orix, primarily known as a leasing firm, and YTC, primarily a parts supplier 
for Toyota.  Enron Japan (EJ) in particular values Orix as a strategic 
partner even beyond the context of EnCom (a fact that was reconfirmed when 
Ken Lay met with their Chairman during his recent week in Tokyo).  

At present, the relationship between EnCom (its vehicle for doing business in 
Japan is E Power; and I will use the two terms interchangeably) and EJ is a 
difficult one.  EnCom entered the Japanese market some months before EJ 
entered, and EnCom was seen in the market as Enron's entry vehicle for 
Japan.  I infer that EnCom has benefited from this association with the Enron 
name, and Enron apparently did not discourage it in the early days.  With the 
arrival of EJ in Tokyo early this year, Enron is working to roll out our 
wholesale/merchant business model in Japan.  EnCom/E Power has and continues 
to receive coverage in the media (much of it self-generated) indicating that 
they intend to sign up customers.  In fact, E Power's COO Mr. Awono, says 
that they will need to sign up retail customers to be able to have load to 
support the large power projects they are planning to do.  (This unlikely 
formula suggests, at least on his part, a degree of naivete, at best, about 
how offtake from plants in deregulated markets can be and should be 
managed.).  Finally, EJ reports meeting with customers, e.g., Sony, who 
indicate that E Power holds itself out as also being a ""trader"".  This has 
caused some confusion in the marketplace about which ""Enron"" entity is 
providing wholesale/merchant services.  

There now also is a question as to what EnCom's business model in Japan 
should be.  Conversations between Orix and EJ personnel in Tokyo suggest that 
Orix believed that Enron would be intimately involved in the day-to-day 
management of EnCom (we are not, and Bruce has conceded that prior to EJ's 
reporting relationship into London being established, Enron involvement and 
direction was largely absent).  Moreover, it appears that Orix also believed 
that EnCom would be engaged in the business of ""aggregation"" of power 
supplies for further resale in the Japanese market (this is essentially 
describing the core Enron merchant business in different terms).  
Conversations between Orix and EJ indicate that Orix now does not see EnCom 
having in place the people and skills to execute on an aggregation business 
strategy.  Rather, Orix sees EnCom as having the skill sets of large-scale 
asset developers, and this is not a business Orix is particularly interested 
in pursuing.  Finally, Orix has an employee secunded to EnCom/E Power, and he 
reports that Orix now even lacks confidence in EnCom's ability to deliver any 
large-scale asset development opportunities.  John and I are tentatively 
scheduled to meet Orix's Chairman in London on 27th November.

To give E Power its due, it is now also frustrated (Wrobel telephone 
conversation with me) because Ken Lay clearly signaled in some of his media 
interviews in Tokyo that we were bringing the full panoply of Enron skills to 
the market, including the possibility of large-scale power projects.  It is 
Wrobel's view that this message in the marketplace now undercuts EnCom, as he 
believes that people will look to a $60 billion market cap company as a 
preferred counterparty for asset development, over a company capitalised at 
present to the tune of about $40 million.  There is also a Business 
Opportunities Agreement between EnCom and EJ addressing how opportunities 
that come to Enron personnel, who are also on EnCom's Board, should be 
handled.    Wrobel believes that we are being a bit narrow in our 
interpretation of the Business Opportunities Agreement, a view I do not 
share. Ken's statements are correct, i.e., we can do large-scale developments 
in JapanIn sum, there is not an agreement as to a clear division of lines of 
business between the two organisations.

At present, frustrations on both sides about confusion in the marketplace and 
in media messages (EnCom has now agreed that Enron will lead all contacts 
with the media, for both firms), have contributed to a situation that is not 
amicable.  Communications in Tokyo between EJ and E Power have virtually 
dried up, though recently EJ has invited E Power to work together on a 
Proposal for Mitsubishi.   

So Where Are We?

John has asked me to lead an effort to evaluate Enron's investment in EnCom.  
This will be fairly comprehensive, including an assessment of the talent on 
the ground in Tokyo, an assessment of the viability of their prospects (both 
in terms of likelihood of permitting, and, to the extent possible, their 
economics), and an assessment of what Enron's stake in this venture ought to 
be going forward.  I will evaluate the full range, from assuming 100% 
control, to a reduced stake (even down to zero), to taking equity in 
particular projects.  As such, I have sent to Wrobel a list of items 
reflecting our initial information requirements for due diligence.  

Second, while this due diligence proceeds, we are also attempting to agree on 
respective roles for EnCom and EJ in the Japanese market.  We remain 
committed to retaining an asset development capability in the market, which 
does not go down well with Wrobel.  We also are sceptical that EnCom has on 
board now, or will acquire, the risk management skills that we believe will 
be necessary to actually manage fuel and offtake along the lines that Enron 
has found highly profitable, e.g., Sutton Bridge tolling.  We have said that 
we respect their talent for being able to develop large-scale assets (though 
our Technical Services Group has already questioned their high staffing 
levels), and that we feel the profit-maximising strategy for both firms is 
for EnCom to develop projects (sites, permits, engineering), with Enron 
holding a tolling agreement and doing the project financing.  We believe E 
Power should be able to develop very bankable deals on this basis.  We do not 
have agreement on this point.  Wrobel seemingly believes that they will be 
able to do the risk management functions, and receive lucrative returns for 
the assets they do develop.  At this early stage we see no evidence that they 
can manage such risks (or that lenders would let them do that), and that it 
is more likely that they will end up with a classic IPP structure with gas 
""in"", PPA ""out"", and reasonable but not rich returns on equity.  Wrobel sees 
our ""tolling agreement"" proposition as taking too much out of EnCom's deals.  
For our part, we have said we are willing to assure attractive equity returns 
(without saying what that number is), and reward them for their development 
efforts.

Our latest effort is to try to agree a tolling arrangement for a project in 
Tohoku province.  E Power has already met local officials.  As it turns out, 
EJ was approached by national government to do a project at the same 
industrial complex as that which E Power is working on.  By letter from me to 
Wrobel of 15 November, Enron has proposed that we pool or combine our efforts 
(i.e., E Power's engineering and local permitting expertise, with Enron's 
political capital garnered at national level), get the project done together 
rather than competing, and divide our labours as noted above, i.e., Enron 
does fuel and off-take, E Power does development of the asset.  In the phone 
call from me to Wrobel that preceded the sending of the letter, Wrobel 
expressed serious displeasure with Enron's proposal.  He and I are to speak 
again; he is to call me back, and if he does not do so on 17 November, I will 
call him on 20 November.         

I will plan to make progress on my wider review assuming cooperation from 
EnCom on our due diligence information requirements.  John and I are 
committed to moving this forward quickly, but much of the necessary 
information is not in hand. 

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

In this case I would say do whatever is easiest for you guys.  Since we know 
that Enron Canada is qualified, we don't really have to have the 
representation but if it is easier for you to not make an exception, it 
doesn't hurt to have it in.

Mark,

Concerning the representation language given to us recently for Canada 
based/located Counterparties; Should we also include this paragraph in Risk 
Management & Trading vs. Enron Canada deals?

I have spoken to Dale Neuner, who has since forwarded me on to you.  He has 
mentioned that, based on your conversation with him, we may not be concerned 
with an intercompany party needing this representation.  Let us know what you 
think.

Thanks,

Mike,

Please see the attached L/C format to cover physical delivery of natural gas 
for one month.

As discussed, the L/C amount should be $1.6 million to expire Oct. 15, 2000.  
In addition the L/C should be in the name of Hilcorp Energy Company.  I also, 
left you an additional voice mail, stating that once we have received a faxed 
copy of the L/C from your bank, we will then be willing to flow gas.

Regards,
Russell

sorry for the delay..I looked at Rod's wkst and it seems fine.

Also, on the Chase agmt - setoff against bank accts - Despain wanted to know 
if there was a cure period before they could do that  (we would insist on 
one).  do we even have any bank accounts with Chase and do they get swept to 
Corp? Kelly Boots did not know so I have a call into Mary Perkins. Other 
questions I have thought of, can it be any Enron afiliate with the bank 
account or just the contracting party? We MUST exclude our custody account 
for securities as this is where we hold securities that are posted to us as 
collateral from third parties.

Thanks,
tanya

Our FX/currency traders in London need an ISDA with MSCI.  Rod prepared a 
credit work sheet on 6/16/00.  The negotiations never went anywhere.  MSCI 
has now sent their form of agreement.  

Do you want to propose new credit or use the existing credit from last year?

Dan Hyvl will call Gary Lamphier with the meter number.  This should go in 
the system as soon as we get the meter number form Dan Hyvl.  We can put this 
deal in the system before the contracts are signed, but we do not want to 
send the Osborn until we have a signed agreement  from ENTEX.   Also, do not 
pay Osborn until we recieve an allocation statement.

I wanted to let you know that we still do not have a deal in the system for 
Osborn.  Gary told Julie that the contract went back to legal and that he was 
waiting to hear from them before he did anything.  You can read Julie's email 
below.  Can you help with the particulars of the deal, especially the point?  
Gary is not sure.  The only detail I got from Osborn was that the price 
should be HSC - 0.20.  I would like to try and get their check out on Monday, 
if we can get the deal in today.

Thanks for bringing me up to speed. My only comment on the letter is that 
instead of saying that we are not ""compelled"" to accept a litigation 
discount, it would be more direct to say that we see no reason to take a 
litigation discount and further discussions premised on the risk of 
litigation will not be fruitful.

I am not sure I fully understand some of the points in the presentation 
materials. If you want to discuss them, please call. (Although whether I 
understand them may not be the point.)

>>> <Garrick.Hill@enron.com> 04/04/01 07:05PM >>>
Hi Tom:

You may know this already, but Angela Davis in our legal group is now
handling matters pertaining to Cornhusker instead of Dan Lyons.  She asked
me to update you on where we are and send along two documents that need
your review prior to them being sent to Brazos.

As you know, Chuck Ward and I have met w/Brazos on three occasions (twice
in Waco in once by phone) since your meeting with them in Dallas on
December 21.  The purpose of those meetings was to further reinforce the
point made by you and Carl Tricoli that, as equity sellers, PPE/ENA values
the Cleburne asset based on its future cash flow with no discount for risks
associated with litigation.

Five developments are of significance since the last time you and I spoke:

   It became apparent to us during our meeting on March 16 that Brazos may
   have problems funding an acquisition at any price.  Specifically, Brazos
   is considering a number of capital projects aimed at securing long-term
   power commitments to fill short positions associated with the Southern
   arrangement rolling off in 2003.  Based on their experience w/the
   Cleburne, TX facility, Brazos appears to be committed to controlling
   their own destiny, and might find it much easier to fund marginal
   projects with an all-in cost (or collateral value) that is closer to
   market.

   Primarily as a result of point 1, Brazos has asked us to look at the
   possibility of PPA restructuring vs. acquisition.

   Also in conjunction with point 1, Brazos has been working with a number
   of potential energy suppliers to secure long-term power commitments.  It
   appears to us that they are preparing to sign some form of commitment
   next week.

   Clifton Karnei sent a letter to Chuck Ward and Steve Tick on March 29
   outlining expectations for a conference call that took place yesterday.
   The letter, which was actually received after the conference call, will
   be faxed to you this afternoon.  Attached is a draft response along with
   a presentation that outlines the manner in which the partnership could
   restructure the PPA.  Steve, while he has not seen the letter, is of the
   opinion that it's Brazos' turn to speak; we may not need the letter, but
   it reinforces a number of points and sets up a restructuring in such a
   way that we might like to send it along.

   We are giving a great deal of thought to the notion that a third party
   might be willing (and able) to pay considerably more for this asset than
   Brazos given its PPA, gas market conditions, and dispatch profile.
   Specifically:

        Southern (having realized the PPA has embedded in it an
        in-the-money call option on gas) has recently begun to ""reverse
        toll"" the plant by turning it back during off-peak hours when the
        net cost of replacement energy (i.e., the absolute price of market
        power less penalties paid under the PPA for heat rate degradation
        on energy taken from the plant plus gas market value) warrants
        economic dispatch.

        This asset commands a control premium from anyone that might be
        engaged (or about to engage) in a long-term, full requirements
        contract with Brazos.

        There are tax benefits associated with this asset that could be
        effectively monetized in a transfer of interests.

   Obviously, we would face the same obstacles that Tenaska faced in
   selling the asset.

Please give me a call when you get a chance.

Regards,

Rick Hill

The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry 
into whether energy consultants advising Gov. Gray Davis used inside 
information to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the state, 
a source with knowledge of the matter said Monday. 
The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in 
response to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones. A 
Republican rival of Davis, Jones charged that stock trading by consultants 
may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based on 
information not available to the public.
On Friday, top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had been 
fired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions and 
their personal finances. 
As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the capital Monday, Davis officials 
were confronted by a flurry of questions about who in the administration owns 
energy stocks. 
Financial disclosure records filed by the governor's spokesman, Steve 
Maviglio, show that he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas company 
he and his boss have accused of making ""obscene"" profits while California has 
been ""on its knees."" Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houston-based 
Enron Corp. in 1996. 
""It's not a crime to own energy stock,"" Maviglio said. 
He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which has the 
largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts. 
Maviglio placed the order for the stock on May 31, one day after San Jose's 
mayor dropped his opposition to a controversial Calpine plant favored by the 
governor and others. Under the terms of Maviglio's purchase, the transaction 
was completed about three weeks later when the stock reached $40 a share, a 
value of $12,000. It has since fallen in value. 
""I viewed it as a good long-term investment,"" Maviglio said, adding that he 
purchased the shares for his retirement account based on publicly available 
information. 
The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms 
that it has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But 
California's grid operator has identified the company as one of many energy 
merchants to overcharge the state millions of dollars. 
The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from 
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. 
Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs secretary Barry 
Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that he recently held 
between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state company accused of 
multimillion-dollar price gouging. 
In a statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month after 
he began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares were 
supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll, but his broker 
failed to do so. 
In light of the recent disclosures, Secretary of State Jones said the 
governor must do more to ensure the public that its interest comes first. 
""The governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated 
conflict of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any 
activity since their last statement of economic interest was filed,"" said 
Jones, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor. 
Word of the SEC's entry into California's energy problems comes as the 
governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for the quick and 
broad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him through the 
crisis. 
In his written request to the SEC, Jones said that recently filed disclosure 
documents showed that at least one consultant bought and sold shares of two 
energy companies within the same month, raising ""a red flag"" about the 
possibility of insider trading. 
State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their 
personal financial interests. 
The five consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter, 
delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was not 
clear which individuals are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether the 
agency's review would result in any charges. 
Two of the former traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by 
federal investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider 
trading. 
But William Mead, fired Thursday, said it is no mystery why so many of his 
colleagues owned Calpine stock. 
Mead said he bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommended 
it to his colleagues last year, while they all still worked for the 
now-defunct California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was not 
traded on that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said. 
Mead and three other energy traders--hired by the state in February and 
March--were terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying power 
for the state from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired traders 
Herman Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of 
their Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to be 
filed only two weeks ago. 
""But I'm sure they bought it while they were still at the power exchange, 
because that's when we discussed it,"" Mead said. ""It was kind of like a 
hobby. I'm sure it wasn't done with the intent to manipulate."" 
Former trader Elaine Griffin, who also owned Calpine stock and resigned two 
weeks ago to take another job, said she didn't know she owned energy 
securities until she checked with her financial advisor July 13, just before 
leaving her state job. 
Griffin said she and her husband own about $10,000 worth of Calpine stock in 
individual retirement accounts managed by their advisor, who bought the stock 
Feb. 1 without their knowledge, she said, after research found it to be a 
good investment. 
""I kind of feel like we've been used for political reasons,"" Griffin said. 
""We would have disclosed anything right at first, but they never asked."" 
As a trader, Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for the 
state, but only at market prices. 
Meanwhile, two Democratic political consultants, who helped Davis polish his 
image after the ongoing energy crisis caused his poll numbers to plummet, 
have agreed to accept no payment for their work as part of an out-of-court 
settlement of a taxpayer lawsuit. 
Tom Hiltachk, a lawyer for conservative anti-tax activist Lewis Uhler, said 
the settlement was reached last Friday after negotiations with lawyers for 
communications consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane. 
""Now they will not receive one red cent,"" said Hiltachk. ""Very simply Mr. 
Fabiani and Mr. Lehane have agreed to cease all activities for the governor, 
to accept no payments for their services and to basically get out of the 
consulting business with the governor."" 
As his part of the agreement, Hiltachk said, Uhler withdrew his lawsuit 
Monday morning. 
Uhler had filed a lawsuit against the two consultants and Controller Kathleen 
Connell in June contending that they should not receive any payments because 
of a conflict of interest. The two men also did consulting work for 
financially troubled Southern California Edison, which was seeking help from 
Davis and the Legislature. 
Connell, a former Los Angeles mayoral candidate who has been at odds with 
Davis since he endorsed an opponent, had held up the payments pending the 
outcome of the lawsuit. 
Under an agreement with Davis, the men were to have been paid $30,000 a month 
for six months. 
Fabiani and Lehane could not be reached for comment.

Davis' top spokesman bought stock in power firm / Adviser denies conflict of 
interest

Chronicle Sacramento Bureau

The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
A.1
(Copyright 2001)

Already on the defensive over its energy advisers' financial holdings, Gov. 
Gray Davis' administration came under fresh attack yesterday when his chief 
spokesman admitted buying $12,000 worth of Calpine Corp. stock last month. 
Steve Maviglio, Davis' acting director of communications, denied that his 
purchase of the San Jose energy company's stock constituted a conflict of 
interest. He said he would sell the stock if Davis or administration lawyers 
asked him to.
""I invested in a growing California company,"" Maviglio said. ""It's sad when 
somebody tries to link owning energy stock with a conflict of interest."" 
The revelation came the same day that two high-priced consultants Davis 
brought in earlier this year to help sell his energy policies to the public 
agreed not to take any money for the work they have done. Davis was 
criticized for hiring the two, partly because they had also worked as 
consultants for Southern California Edison. 
On Friday, Davis fired five energy advisers for possible conflict- 
of-interest problems after they helped negotiate state spot-market purchases 
or long-term power contracts. Four of the five owned stock in Calpine, and 
the fifth held Enron shares. 
ON THE DEFENSIVE 
Maviglio, who had the task of explaining the firings, was on the defensive 
himself yesterday. 
He bought the Calpine stock in June after asking his broker to invest in it 
when shares hit a certain price, he said. He said that showed he had made his 
decision independently of whatever action he might have taken in the 
governor's office on any particular day. 
Calpine's stock has dropped some in the past month. As of yesterday, the 300 
shares that Maviglio bought for $12,000 were worth about $11,100. 
Maviglio said he had spoken out against Calpine as much as other energy 
companies. He also owns Enron stock that he bought in February 1996 and has 
disclosed on all forms, he added. 
""I've called them pirates and gougers and lumped them in with all the rest of 
the generators,"" Maviglio said. 
Secretary of State Bill Jones, an announced GOP opponent of Davis for 
governor in 2002, said Maviglio should be fired. 
""These actions are unethical and unacceptable,"" said Jones, who called on the 
governor's staff to release updated conflict-of- interest statements. ""He had 
the power to promote Calpine through press releases. That seems to me to be a 
clear conflict of interest."" 
Calpine sold the state $14 million worth of power earlier this year and has a 
large share of the $43 billion in long-term contracts for electricity that 
the state has entered into. 
Earlier this month, when he threw the ceremonial switch on a new Calpine 
plant in Pittsburg, Davis singled out the company as being more cooperative 
with California than out-of-state suppliers that the governor has 
characterized as gougers. 
IMAGE-POLISHING 
The Davis administration tried to put another energy-related controversy 
behind it yesterday as the two consultants brought in by the governor to 
burnish his image agreed to forgo more than $50,000 in work they did for the 
state. 
Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani will receive no compensation and will leave the 
Davis administration immediately, under a settlement in a lawsuit filed on 
behalf of a national taxpayer rights group. 
Lehane and Fabiani -- nicknamed the ""Masters of Disaster"" for their work in 
getting former President Bill Clinton out of political jams -- started in the 
governor's office in May and were originally supposed to be paid $30,000 a 
month. 
It was later revealed that they had also worked as consultants for Southern 
California Edison, which is trying to swing a deal with the state to avoid 
bankruptcy. State Controller Kathleen Connell said she would not pay the two. 
""It really raises the question in my mind, what is it about 
conflict-of-interest and other ethical rules that the governor's office 
doesn't understand?"" said Lewis Uhler, president of the National Tax 
Limitation Committee, which filed the lawsuit. 
In June, Davis said Fabiani was no longer a communications consultant because 
his work had been ""successfully implemented."" Lehane, on the other hand, 
dropped his contract with Edison and signed a new agreement with Davis. 
Lehane's new contract required him to work a maximum of 66 hours a month at 
$150 an hour. His payments were to be capped at $76,000 for work from June 26 
to Nov. 20, 2001. 
'OUTRAGEOUS EXPENSE' 
""This was an outrageous expense to taxpayers,"" Uhler said. ""I believe there 
was a clear violation of conflict-of-interest laws."" 
The consultants decided it was not worth the legal fees to fight the lawsuit, 
Maviglio said. The two could not be reached for comment. 
""It's shameful when people have to surrender their jobs in public service 
because of a lawsuit,"" Maviglio said. 
Jones, who filed a complaint with the Fair Political Practices Commission 
concerning the two consultants, said, ""I think it's clear from recent actions 
by the governor's office that there have been rampant violations of the 
state's conflict-of-interest laws. Their attempts to mitigate the damage from 
these violations is too little, too late."" 
Jones said Davis should immediately require all of the consultants hired 
during the energy crisis to file financial statements. There are 21 advisers 
involved in power purchasing whom Davis has exempted, he said. 
All the contractors who are required to file reports have done so, said 
Maviglio. 
In a related development, the Los Angeles Times quoted a source as saying the 
Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry into 
whether energy consultants advising Davis used inside information to trade 
stocks of power companies doing business with the state. 
The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in 
response to a request from Jones.

Davis press secretary confirms buying energy company stock
By ALEXA HAUSSLER
Associated Press Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Gov. Gray Davis' press secretary recently purchased 
the same energy stock as five consultants the governor fired last week, he 
disclosed Monday. 
Steve Maviglio confirmed that on June 20, he bought 300 shares of stock in 
Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based power generator that has received about $13 
billion in state contracts to supply electricity for up to 20 years.
Maviglio's disclosure comes after Davis' office hastily ended the contracts 
of five consultants who helped negotiate state power contracts and held stock 
in energy companies. 
In a related development, an anonymous source told the Los Angeles Times on 
Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary 
inquiry into whether the consultants used inside information to trade the 
energy stocks. 
About two dozen Davis energy consultants were required to fill out financial 
disclosure statements after complaints of conflict of interest by Republicans 
and consumer groups. 
""When we reviewed them, we found possible violations of the law and took 
swift action,"" Maviglio said Monday before Secretary of State Bill Jones 
issued a press release calling for his termination. 
Jones, a Republican, is a candidate for the GOP nomination to challenge Davis 
in November 2002. 
Maviglio defended his purchase, saying that he ""owns several stocks in 
companies in all fields that are growing and are based in California."" 
Maviglio said Monday that he requested on May 31 to purchase the stock if it 
dipped to $40 a share, which it did two days after a June 18 ruling by 
federal energy regulators restricting wholesale electricity prices in 
California and 10 other states. 
Maviglio served as Davis' chief spokesman urging the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission to impose price ceilings on electricity wholesalers. 
He also said he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 stock in Houston-based 
Enron Corp. He said he purchased the stock in 1997 and has reported it on 
financial disclosure forms. He said that it is ""closer to $10,000."" 
Meanwhile, two energy consultants to Davis have agreed to forgo more than 
$50,000 in work they did for the state. 
Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani will forgo the payments as part of a settlement 
with a Sacramento-area resident who filed a lawsuit objecting to their 
hiring, calling it a conflict of interest. 
Fabiani could not be reached for comment Monday. In the settlement, they 
admitted no wrongdoing. 
Lehane issued a statement through the governor's office, calling it ""simply 
not worth the bother to challenge the controller in court."" 
Davis has come under fire for his May hiring of Lehane, former press 
secretary for Vice President Al Gore, and Fabiani, a deputy campaign manager 
for Gore's presidential run. 
They were hired to help shape Davis' response to the energy crisis, and 
helped craft Davis' aggressive attack on Texas-based energy companies and 
President Bush. 
Both also have advised Southern California Edison, which is negotiating for 
state help in avoiding bankruptcy. Financial disclosure forms showed they 
have each received at least $10,000 from Edison in the past year. 
Davis announced at the end of June that Fabiani terminated his contract, and 
Davis scaled back Lehane's role with the state. 
State Controller Kathleen Connell then said she would not pay Lehane and 
Fabiani for any of their work and now the two have agreed they will not fight 
her decision, Maviglio said. 
Lewis K. Uhler, the Placer County man who filed the lawsuit, said the 
settlement ""accomplished our objectives."" 
""We wanted to block the egregious use of taxpayer funds for essentially 
political spinmeisters,"" he said. Uhler is president of the Roseville-based 
National Tax Limitation Committee. 
Maviglio said that Fabiani and Lehane ""did good work for the state"" and 
helped the state win victories with federal regulators.

India's Power Boards Lose $5 Bln as Subsidies Rise, Paper Says
2001-07-31 01:53 (New York)


     New Delhi, July 31 (Bloomberg) -- India's state
electricity boards that distribute power lost 260 billion
rupees ($5.5 billion) in the year ended March because of rising
subsidies and electricity thefts, the Business Standard
reported, citing government figures.
     Power subsidies, mainly to farmers, rose 12 percent to
370.37 billion rupees last year and made up for half the
average tariff of 2.12 rupees a kilowatt-hour. Subsidies have
risen 83 percent since 1997.
     Power costs have risen 41 percent the past three years to
3.03 rupees a kilowatt-hour though the growth in tariffs has
been lower at 28 percent, leading to losses, the paper said.
     Forced to sell subsidized power to farmers and hurt by
power thefts, electricity boards are unable to pay power
generators. Two U.S. power producers, Enron Corp. and AES
Corp., have asked the government to buy out their stakes in
local power projects because of unpaid bills.



India To Evaluate Options On Enron Stake Buy Out Offer

07/31/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India will evaluate all options before making a 
decision on U.S. energy major Enron Corp.'s (ENE) offer to sell its majority 
stake in the controversial Dabhol Power Co. to the government, a senior 
Indian Power Ministry official said Tuesday. 
""We are closely watching all the developments. Enron hasn't formally 
approached us with an offer. It will be premature to say anything on the 
issue now. The government will take a stand on the Enron matter only after 
thoroughly studying all the prospects and consequences,"" said the official.
A spokesman for Dabhol Power Co. said his company has had no contact with the 
federal government lately. 
Enron said Saturday the company wanted to sell its stake in Dabhol Power Co. 
to India's federal government or one of the project's lenders. 
Enron holds a controlling 65% equity in Dabhol Power Co., located in the 
western Indian state of Maharashtra. The Dabhol Power Co. plant has a 
capacity to generate 740 megawatts but is currently not operating because of 
payment disputes with its sole buyer, the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board. MSEB stopped drawing electricity from Dabhol May 29, saying the 
company's tariffs were ""unaffordable."" 
Work on an 85% complete 1,444 MW phase II of the Dabhol project was stopped 
in mid-June because of Dabhol Power Co.'s financial difficulties. 
At $2.9 billion, Dabhol Power Co. is the single largest foreign investment in 
India to date.

INDIA PRESS:Govt Asks Lenders To Bail Out Dabhol Pwr Proj

07/31/2001
Dow Jones Asian Equities Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India's federal government has directed financial 
institutions, led by the Industrial Development Bank of India (P.IDB), to 
work out a package for saving the controversial $2.9 billion Dabhol power 
project in the western Indian state of Maharahtra, reports the Financial 
Express. 
U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) holds a controlling 65% stake in Dabhol 
Power Co., which operates a 740-megawatt power plant.
The move comes on the heels of Enron's decision to pull out of India's power 
sector, says the newspaper report. 
The package is aimed at completing the 1,444-megawatt phase II of the Dabhol 
project. A sum of $550 million is required to complete the project, of which 
lenders have agreed to pump in around $320 million. As Enron doesn't want to 
inject fresh money into Dabhol, the financial institutions will either have 
to scout for a new investor for the project or pump in the remaining $230 
million themselves, the report said.

Report: Indian government orders financial institutions to save Dabhol power 
project, as Enron wants to pull out

07/31/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

NEW DELHI, India (AP) - The federal government has told financial 
institutions to pump in more money or find a new investor to save the Dabhol 
power project, now that U.S.-based Enron Corp. has said it wants out, The 
Financial Express reported Tuesday. 
The Industrial Development Bank of India, and other institutions, have been 
told to work out a package to complete the dlrs 2.9 billion project in 
western Maharashtra state, the paper said, quoting unidentified officials of 
the banks and the Power Ministry.
Power Ministry officials were quoted as saying that Enron had agreed in 
principle to finish the project if the dlrs 230 million can be found, and 
then Enron could sell its majority stake. 
The project was billed as the world's largest natural gas-fired power plant, 
able to generate 2,184 megawatts once completed at Dabhol, 335 kilometers 
(210 miles) south of Bombay. The second phase, to be run on liquefied natural 
gas, was to be commissioned by the end of the year. 
Enron, based in Houston, Texas has invested dlrs 875 million in the project - 
India's biggest foreign investment. Enron said July 28 it wants the Indian 
government and lenders to buy out its 65 per cent stake. 
The plant stopped production in May after its only customer, the Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board, said it was canceling a seven-year-old power 
purchase agreement. The state also stopped buying power from Enron's 
two-year-old naphtha plant. 
The state says Enron's prices are too high and has demanded the contract be 
renegotiated. 
The Financial Express said that lenders are ready to pump another dlrs 320 
million into Dabhol, but there is a shortfall of an additional dlrs 230 
million. 
The financial institutions will have to find a new investor or provide the 
money themselves, the newspaper quoted its sources as saying. 
It also quoted Power Ministry officials as saying it would be difficult to 
find a buyer until the project is completed. Some of the needed money may be 
sought from Maharashtra state, which had committed to making payments, the 
paper quoted Power Ministry officials as saying. 
The current charges for power are still a matter of contention, however. 
The paper said Enron had reduced its price demands, after the government 
offered various tax and customs duty concessions, but the government wants 
the price for electricity to be cut further.

FIs asked to work out deal for Dabhol completion
Soma Banerjee

07/31/2001
The Economic Times
Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)

FINANCIAL institutions led by Industrial Development Bank of India have been 
directed by the Centre to work out a package by which the controversial 
Dabhol Power plant can be completed which in turn could pave the way for the 
sale of equity by Enron. 
Enron, which has a $2.9 billion stake in the project has recently announced 
its decision to pull out of India. This comes barely weeks after the visit of 
Enrons chairman Kenneth Lay who had then maintained that the 'company is 
committed to India' and is looking forward to 'positive talks'.
The package which will be submitted to a high level committee, which is 
represented by the finance, power and law ministry and headed by union 
finance secretary Ajit Kumar. Representatives of the Union power and finance 
ministry met last week to thrash out the main objectives of the package. 
According to FI sources, the package which is expected to be finalised 
shortly will have to have a twin objective of completing the project and 
finding takers for the power to be generated. 
The phase II of the project (phase I of which is already operational) 
requires an additional investment of $550 million to be completed of which 
$320 million has already been tied up with the lenders. 
Another $230 million has to be pumped in into the project. Given the fact 
that Enron is unwilling to pump in any more funds in the project, the FIs 
will have to look for the additional resources. 
The required resources can be moped up only through the infusion of fresh 
investments by a new developer or if the FIs are willing to put in the money 
themselves. 
FIs are also holding discussions with MSEB to honour their obligation and pay 
up the fixed charges of about Rs 95 crore which could then be used for 
completing the project. 
Sources said although Enron has decided to call it a day in the Indian power 
sector, the company is not averse to the proposal of completing this project 
without any further investments. Experts are of the view that this would make 
sense even for Enron who could then expect a better price for its equity. 
On the sale of power and restructuring of tariff, the FIs are holding 
negotiations with DPC and the various agencies who play a role in 
contributing to the tariff. While DPC has offered a tariff of Rs 3.59 per 
unit, the FIs will try and work towards a tariff close to Rs 2.80 per unit. 
Apart from aspects like working a separate arrangement for the LNG plant, 
reduction in Customs duty and sales tax on LNG, attempts would be made to 
also try and reduce LNG prices by asking the suppliers to rework their rates. 
Official sources indicated that Enrons decision to finally announce its 
intention to exit from the Dabhol project is likely to lead to some decision 
this way or the other. 
The Centre which has till now played a passive role and has left the issue to 
be resolved bilaterally is now playing a more proactive role and will 
definitely take every step to avoid litigations at the international lenders 
level.

Houston-Area Firms Brace for Onslaught by Code Red Computer Worm

Reporter (TM)

Technicians at Reliant Communications and other Internet service providers 
will burn the midnight oil tonight and well into Wednesday, fighting the 
rebirth of an Internet worm some say could be the worst threat to the Web to 
date. 
The Code Red worm, an online infection first spotted on July 19, is expected 
to awaken from its dormant state on hundreds of thousands of computers around 
the world at about 7 p.m. CST today. Tuesday. It will then start flooding the 
Internet with traffic as it tries to replicate itself, creating the 
equivalent of an overwhelming number of surfers hitting the Web at once.
Dave Power, senior vice president of technology at Reliant Communications, 
said nearly every Internet service provider is taking the threat seriously 
and will monitor it carefully as it develops. 
""At the end of our staff meeting today the message we all left with was, `Be 
prepared for the siege,'"" Power said. 
Unlike a virus, which spreads when a user opens an e-mail attachment, Code 
Red is a self-propagating worm that spreads itself without human 
intervention. 
When Code Red first showed up earlier this month it infected more than 
250,000 systems in just nine hours, security officials say. It tried to shut 
down the White House's Web server by sending a flood of data requests its 
way, but officials changed the Internet Protocol address, the numeric 
reference to a computer's location on the Internet, of the White House site 
before the attack began. 
When the worm reactivates Tuesday tonight it could begin spreading more 
quickly, bringing sporadic but widespread Internet slowdowns and defacing Web 
pages. 
The potential threat to Internet service is so severe that several federal 
agencies and companies, including the FBI and Microsoft, held a joint press 
conference Monday. 
""The Internet has become indispensable to our national security and economic 
well-being,"" said Ron Dick, head of the National Infrastructure Protection 
Center, an arm of the FBI. ""Worms like Code Red pose a distinct threat to the 
Internet."" 
Code Red scans the Internet for Web servers, sending a string of code to 
those machines that takes up residence not in the hard drive but in the 
buffer memory where it is difficult to detect. The worm targets servers 
running Microsoft Windows NT and Windows 2000 with Internet Information 
Server, or IIS, software versions 4.0 and 5.0. 
The worm isn't likely to infect the computers most people have at home or on 
their desktops at work, but rather will infect Web servers, the powerful 
machines kept in air-conditioned data centers that let people view Web sites 
online. That means any sort of Web surfing, from checking e-mail to buying 
books online to looking up stock quotes, may be anywhere from significantly 
slow to nearly impossible. 
""So the ordinary person using a cable modem or DSL won't be infected, and 
they don't need to worry about their privacy or confidentiality,"" said Chris 
Pick, vice president of product strategy for Houston-based PentaSafe Security 
Technologies. ""But they will notice that some of the Web sites they want to 
hit are either running slowly or are simply not available."" 
Unlike an e-mail virus, which spreads when a user opens an e-mail attachment, 
Code Red is a self-propagating worm that spreads itself without human 
intervention. 
Code Red scans the Internet for Web servers, sending a string of code to 
those machines that takes up residence not in the hard drive, but in the 
buffer memory where it is difficult to detect. The worm targets servers 
running Microsoft's Internet Information Server, or IIS, software versions 
4.0 and 5.0. 
From within a server Code Red begins scanning a randomly generated list of 
Internet addresses to find another server to infect. If the infected server's 
default language is English, all Web pages served by that machine will be 
defaced with the message ""HELLO! Welcome to http://www.worm.com! Hacked by 
Chinese!"" 
Officials say they have not identified the author of the program, but its 
name is said to be a reference to a soda made by Mountain Dew that is popular 
with hackers, and the name is not a reference to ""Red"" China. 
Officials say they have not identified the author of the virus, but its name 
is said to be a reference to a popular soda made by Mountain Dew with hackers 
and not China. 
The real problems created by Code Red are not related to security or privacy 
issues, or even the Web page graffiti, but rather the amount of traffic that 
will be generated by hundreds of thousands of Web servers sending out data 
packets searching for other machines to infect. 
The first 19 days of a month the worm is set up to scan and infect, but from 
day 20 until day 27 the worm floods a certain Internet address -- in this 
case the White House Web server -- with information requests causing a 
denial-of-service attack. 
The White House changed its Internet address prior to the attack earlier this 
month and avoided being knocked out, but that didn't kill off Code Red. The 
worm has been sitting dormant on servers for the past two weeks, but when the 
date changes from 31st to the 1st, it will begin scanning for new hosts to 
infect again. 
A software patch to fix the Microsoft IIS program's vulnerability has been 
available since June, a few weeks after developers and security experts found 
the problem. Unfortunately, not enough system administrators and Web masters 
installed it before the outbreak. 
""Hacker groups in general are aware of these vulnerabilities, but they can be 
taken care of relatively easily with just a little vigilance,"" Pick said. 
Jeremy Hewlett, security administrator for Reliant Communications, said 
downloading the software patch should be the first priority for any system 
administrator. In addition to the Microsoft site, the National Infrastructure 
Protection Center, www.nipc.gov, and Symantec Co., www.symantec.com cq for 
both addresseshave information about detecting and removing the worm. 
Observers say Microsoft products are common targets for virus writers because 
the software is found running on so many sites and because Microsoft has not 
always been as attentive to security issues as it could be. 
""With Windows NT and Windows 2000 they were engineered to work in tandem with 
a lot of other systems at once, so security was not engineered into the 
products from the start,"" Pick said. ""They haven't focused on it much in the 
past but are starting to become more aware of it."" 
Microsoft is known for not testing its products as well as it could either, 
Power said, which also leads to many post-release patches and updates. 
""They're not very forthcoming with problems, which is why you'll see most 
people go to the public and press with issues first,"" Power said. 
Microsoft took part in the public warnings about Code Red on Monday and has 
been providing the patch for free on its Web site for weeks. 
Hewlett said the staff at Reliant Communications has already cleared its 
network of the worm but is expecting to work late Tuesday night monitoring 
incoming attacks from other infected servers. University networks are among 
some of the likely breeding grounds since schools' Information Technology 
departments tend to be particularly short-staffed in the summers. 
""We saw enormous volumes of traffic from the schools last time, but nobody 
really monitors the university networks for this,"" he said. 
While the denial-of-service attack aimed at the White House could have been 
damaging if it had not been redirected in time, there's nothing stopping a 
virus writer from setting his or her sights on another target, like a 
company's Web site. 
""It could be Enron's site, it could be any other government site, or any part 
of the net's infrastructure that's vital to the economy,"" Pick said. ""Houston 
is just as likely as any other city to be infected.""

Calif Gov Spokesman Says He Bought Calpine Stock In June

07/30/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis purchased shares of 
Calpine Corp (CPN) on June 20, 2001, he said Monday, but declined to say how 
many shares he purchased. 
This is the first time an official in Davis' office has admitted to 
purchasing shares in energy companies since the state took on the job of 
buying power in January in lieu of the utilities.
As reported, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been 
investigating Davis administration officials for more than a month to see if 
they purchased stock in energy companies using information that was 
unavailable to the public. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said, however, that 
his stock holdings did
not represent a conflict of interest. Maviglio has not been named in the
SEC investigation, and says he made his purchases based on public
information. 

""There's no crime in owning energy company stocks,"" Maviglio said. ""My 
purchase of Calpine was based on information I read in the newspapers."" 
Maviglio also owns between $10,001-$100,000 in Enron Corp (ENE) stock, 
according to a 2000/2001 financial disclosure form. He said he has owned 
Enron stock since 1996. 

Last week, five state energy consultants were fired by Davis' staff for 
conflicts of interest because they helped California buy power from Calpine, 
a company in which they owned stock, state officials said. 
The consultants, who were hired by the state in January, did not file 
economic interest statements until July, when Secretary of State Bill Jones 
revealed that the consultants and energy traders held stocks in energy 
companies they were buying from. Jones said Monday that Maviglio's actions 
were ""unethical, unconscionable and unacceptable."" 
""The Governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated 
conflict of interest statements to reflect current holdings and any activity 
since their last Statement of Economic Interests was filed,"" Jones said in a 
statement. Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Democrat Davis next 
year for governor and who has been highly critical of Davis' handling of the 
energy crisis, also called for an expansion of investigations. 
""The SEC, the Attorney General and the Fair Political Practices Commission 
must now expand their investigations to include all of the Governor's staff 
in addition to the consultants who are already under investigation,"" the 
statement said. 
Attorney General Bill Lockyer has not yet decided whether he will launch an 
investigation into the Davis administration, a Lockyer spokeswoman said. 
The governor's own investments are in a blind trust, meaning a trustee 
handles Davis' financial affairs and the governor has no knowledge of the 
investments. 
""I have always owned mutual funds and have never bought stock in individual 
companies. That has been my policy since the beginning of my administration,"" 
Davis said Monday at a bill-signing event in Los Angeles. 
State conflict-of-interest laws say that public officials cannot negotiate 
contracts for companies in which they hold stock, and officials cannot use 
their positions to influence the state's decisions with respect to those 
companies. 
The conflict-of-interest laws apply to all state bodies, including the 
California Public Utilities Commission and the California Independent System 
Operator, which runs the state's real-time energy market. 
The five members of the ISO Board of Governors listed no holdings in energy 
companies since Jan. 24 on their most recent disclosure forms, signed between 
Jan. 24-July 24. The board was appointed by Davis in January. Disclosure 
forms for the CPUC and employees with the California Department of Water 
Resources, the state's power-buying arm, could not be immediately obtained. 
SEC investigators said Sunday that a preliminary investigation has revealed 
that several employees and consultants working directly with Davis on energy 
issues have purchased ""significant"" shares of Calpine stock between January 
and July. Individuals purchased stocks in other energy companies, but 
invested heavily in Calpine, the investigators said. Nearly half of the 
state's $43 billion in long-term energy pacts will come from Calpine, 
according to details of contracts released last month. Some of the contracts 
were signed as early as February, but Davis had refused to release the 
details of the supply until a Superior Court Judge ordered the administration 
to do so in mid-June after news organizations filed a lawsuit. 
Davis has accused power suppliers of price gouging, and his attorney general 
hopes to send power company executives to jail. But Davis has spared Calpine 
the invective, touting the San Jose-based generator as a ""California company"" 
helping to keep the lights on in the state. 
Maviglio has said the governor has praised Calpine because its prices are 
well below those charged by other generators and because the company has 
invested in California for the long haul. 
Calpine is ""not attempting to suck every dime out of the state and throw 
parties in Houston,"" he said.

Functioning In The Bandwidth Market No One Expected
By Erwin Seba
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

07/30/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Band-X Ltd., the longest-lived bandwidth exchange, has 
survived by moving as the market has developed, said a London-based analyst 
of the London-based company. 
""Their business model is sound,"" Ciara Ryan, senior manager in the bandwidth 
trading department at Arthur Andersen's London office, told Dow Jones 
Newswires. ""They understand the limitations of the market. They didn't try to 
fix the world overnight.""
Band-X began trading bandwidth in 1997, two years before Enron Corp. (ENE), 
announced it was going to be a market-maker in bandwidth trading. 
But, a company executive said part of the reason for his company's success is 
it lacks an energy- merchant background. 
""The difference between gas and bandwidth is you can't store bandwidth,"" 
Donald Noonan, vice president of Networks, told Dow Jones. In 2000, the 
privately held company saw $80 million in bandwidth trades, Noonan said. 
The company has offices across Europe, Asia and in the U.S. 
The company also operates a telecommunications minutes exchange and a 
colocation exchange, which is increasing business as companies seek to gain 
some return on an investment in a network with rapidly declining profit 
potential, while others seek to buy or lease what they would otherwise build. 
""We are constantly seeing the leasing of capacity,"" Noonan said. 
But the contract time periods are shifting from the previously common 20-year 
lease to 1-year or 10- or 20-year contracts, he said. 
And the company has won favorable reviews from the most conservative part of 
the market, the carriers, Ryan said. 
""They have a lot critical mass and lot of support in the marketplace,"" she 
said.

INDIA: India evaluating Enron's offer to quit Dabhol.

07/30/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW DELHI, July 30 (Reuters) - Indian officials said on Monday they were 
evaluating an offer by U.S. energy firm Enron to sell its stake in troubled 
Dabhol power project to the federal government. 
A spokesman for the Dabhol Power Company, in which Enron holds a 65-percent 
stake, said on Saturday the firm and its partners wanted to sell equity in 
the project to the federal government or the lenders.
""We are assessing the situation. It is too premature to say anything right 
now,"" a senior federal power ministry official, who did not want to be 
identified, told Reuters. 
He said the federal government had not received any formal offer from Enron 
to sell its equity in the controversial project. 
Government sources said that ministry officials were talking to Indian 
financial institutions to assess Enron's statement. 
A power ministry official said if the federal government picked up Enron's 
equity in the project, it could save the government millions of dollars in 
penalties which it would have to pay if it lost an arbitration case over the 
project. 
Apart from Enron, DPC's shareholders include U.S. group General Electric and 
Bechtel, which own 10 percent each, and a local utility, the Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board (MSEB), which holds 15 percent. 
Enron has been locked in a bitter payment dispute with MSEB, which had signed 
a contract to buy all the power produced by Dabhol, whose first phase of 740 
MW was completed last year, and the second phase of 1,444 MW is nearly 
complete. 
A BLESSING 
India's western state of Maharashtra, where the project is located, welcomed 
Enron's offer to sell its equity in the controversial project, the Press 
Trust of India reported. 
""It will be God's biggest blessing for us,"" the agency quoted the state's 
Energy Minister Padamsinh Patil as saying in Bombay. 
It also quoted the head of a negotiating committee, M. Godbole as saying that 
the panel's next meeting, scheduled after a month, would be cancelled in view 
of Enron's statement that it wants to exit Dabhol. 
MSEB and Enron's dispute escalated in April, when the U.S. firm notified the 
government it was applying to an arbitration court in London to consider its 
claim for 1.02 billion rupees owed by MSEB for power it purchased in December 
from DPC. 
The company also sent a political force majeure notice to MSEB. Such a notice 
is a contractual clause dissatisfied parties give as a first step towards 
possibly dissolving a contract. 
In May, the defaulting utility stopped buying power from Dabhol, saying it 
was expensive.

California Governor's Spokesman Says He Bought Calpine Stock
2001-07-30 21:36 (New York)

California Governor's Spokesman Says He Bought Calpine Stock

     Sacramento, California, July 30 (Bloomberg) -- A spokesman
for California Governor Gray Davis said bought $12,000 worth of
stock in energy producer Calpine Corp. in June as the state was
working with the company to open new power plants and buying
millions of dollars a day in electricity.
     Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio purchased 300 shares of
Calpine on June 20 after putting in an order on May 31 to buy the
stock when it fell to $40, he said. The purchase is being reviewed
by the Governor's legal office, Maviglio said.
     ``These purchases were based on no knowledge of anything,
just public information about a growing California company,''
Maviglio said. ``I've informed the governor, the chief of staff
and our legal counsel today. I'd be glad to divest myself if
that's what required.''
     Maviglio also said he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in
Enron Corp. shares, which he said he purchased in 1996. His
purchases came to light three days after California officials said
they fired five consultants hired to advise California on energy
after they disclosed that they owned shares of Calpine.
     The consultants worked for the Department of Water Resources,
which at the time was buying millions in electricity from Calpine
and other energy generators. California has spent almost $8
billion buying electricity for its two largest utilities, which
have been insolvent since January.
     Nine energy consultants were ordered by Davis's lawyer Barry
Goode last week to sell any energy-company stock they owned,
including shares of Enron Corp., Calpine Corp., and Dynegy Inc.,
after Secretary of State Bill Jones pressured Davis to release
details of their holdings.
     Jones said today in a statement that Maviglio should be fired
for the purchases.
     ``These actions are unethical, unconscionable, unacceptable
and heads should role,'' Jones said. ``Mr. Maviglio should be
fired immediately.''
     Jones has publicly called on Davis to force the 50
consultants hired by the state to disclose their holdings in
energy companies. Last week he urged the Securities and Exchange
Commission to investigate whether any of the consultants or
advisers traded stock based on non-public information.
     Maviglio said no one in the administration or at the
Department of Water Resources had been contacted by the SEC. ``No
one's been contacted either here or at DWR,'' Maviglio said.
     A spokeswoman for the SEC in San Francisco, Helane Morrison,
said the agency would not confirm or deny an investigation.
     Calpine shares are down 6.8 percent since June 20, when
Maviglio says he purchased the shares.

Tom Engel (Sitara) has moved the big Entex ticket (#117413) for July 2000 
forward to deal #292249.  This should help some with amount of time it takes 
to update and bridge back this deal.  He is adjusting the swap tickets also.  
You should probably double check these to make sure everything looks ok.  

The programmers are also trying to find ways to further decrease the time

Subject: Sierra Pacific Power/Nevada Power



Elizabeth, 

Background: On Wednesday, October 10, the NPUC voted to authorize its General Counsel to seek to void or renegotiate certain SPP/NP long-term power contracts by either going to court or filing a complaint at FERC.  According to the utilities, the contracts are out-of-the-money by approximately $800 million. 

Enclosed, you'll find. . . .:  Attached is a spreadsheet showing all of the physical Enron-SPP/NP deals that are (1) currently flowing or (2) scheduled for future delivery.  I have left off transactions that have been completed because the tenor of SPP/NP's statements indicates that they are seeking prospective relief, not refunds.

I am also going to fax to you two pages showing our credit exposure to SPP and NP.  Worst case, back of the envelope, we are looking at approximately $400 million in MTM exposure for all deals.  However, the prices under these deals range from $27.50/MWh to $311/MWh (the $3.60 deal is for transmission).  It's extremely unlikely that FERC would (1) void every transaction or (2) reduce the price for every deal to $0.  Therefore, the true amount at risk is less than $400 million.

Bottom line:  All in all, I think the risk of FERC undoing these transactions is unlikely for the following reasons: 

1.  The ALJ in the Pacific Northwest refund case rejected claims for refunds of bilateral transactions because (1) the non-California long-term market was competitive, and (2) because of the concern about ""ripple"" claims.  Although the Commission has not yet adopted the ALJ's recommendation, I expect they will because it's the path of least resistance and has popular support.

2.  SPP/NP is the only party arguing that the Southwest market is uncompetitive.  This aspect was fatal to the Pacific Northwest claims because the majority of the market did not want refunds.

3.  SPP/NP was not required to buy power under these contracts----unlike the California utilities, which were required to buy from the PX.  Presumably, these were the lowest prices available at the time.

4.  If FERC voids or reprices these contracts, it will be pressured to do the same for California's DWR contracts. 

Contracts/Collateral:  These transactions are all under the WSPP.  We currently hold no collateral from SPP/NP.  Tracy Ngo informs me that we have not insisted on margin or additional collateral because her understanding was that the WSPP did not let her ask for collateral absent an objective event, such as a credit downgrade or failure to get a rate increase.  I advised her that the WSPP standard allows for a call for collateral if the counterparty's ""financial viability"" decreases.  My view is that SPP/NP's admission that it is $800 million under water is, in itself, cause for a margin call.  I am, however, sensitive to the fact that a margin call might (1) be perceived as ""punishing"" SPP/NP for ""trying to enforce the law,"" or (2) strengthen SPP/NP's resolve to seek refunds.  Tracy will not request collateral until you have weighed in on this.

Mitigation:  I spoke with Tim Belden and Tracy Ngo about this on Monday the 15th.  There is zero interest in trying to work with SPP/NP on a blend/extend.  ""Why should we loan a shaky counterparty more money?""  There is also the feeling that we stand a great chance of winning at FERC.  Ultimately, we three were unable to come up with any ways to mitigate the exposure, other than being ready to vigorously respond to this challenge at FERC and being prepared to issue a statement to the press after the complaint is filed at FERC.

The agreements look ok.  We discussed earlier the issue of whether or not the 
Lakeland agreement needed an out for filing with the Florida Public Service 
Commission or whether this filing was already made.  If I remeber correctly, 
you were going to check on that.  Did you have a chance to find anything out?

Re:
-- Amendments to NYMEX Division Position Limit and Reporting Rules
-- Amendments to Large Trader Reporting Requirements for Light Sweet
        Crude Oil and the Addition of Brent Crude Oil

The Board of Directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. has approved 
various amendments to NYMEX Division Chapter 9 rules which, in general, move 
away from hard position limits ""in any one month and all months combined"" to 
position accountability standards. These amendments shall be effective as of 
the open of trading on Friday, June 15, 2001.

The amendments to any one month, all months combined and option quadrants 
limits as cited in Rule 9.26, position accountability will provide for the 
ability for any participant to exceed the prescribed levels. (As a note: the 
levels advocated for any one month and all months combined are the levels 
currently in place for all months combined under the existing rule structure. 
The currently defined any one month limits, which are lower than the all 
months limits, are being deleted. Additionally, the gross side of market 
rules are deleted.) Any market participant exceeding the defined position 
accountability levels will be subject to being contacted by the Exchange when 
the Exchange deems it necessary, and will be required to supply relevant 
information as to its position and the status of its account. If the 
participant refuses to do so, or if the Exchange believes the position, by 
its size, is a threat to the orderly operation of the market, a market 
participant can be direct!
ed!
 either to not increase or to decrease its position.

The existing current delivery month on expiration limits as defined in 
existing Rule 9.27 will be unchanged and subject to hedge/swap exemptions as 
they are today. The only caveat to this is that certain cash-settled enymexsm 
contracts will operate with some level of position accountability in the 
current delivery month.

Further, the large trader reporting levels cited in Rule 9.34 for Light Sweet 
Crude Oil futures has been amended from 300 to 350 contracts to coincide with 
existing CFTC standards. The soon to be traded Brent Crude Oil futures' 
reporting level has been added at the same level of 350 contracts.

Lastly, the any one month/all months position accountability level for the 
Brent Crude Oil contract of 20,000 has been added.

All amended rules can be found on the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. 
website @ http://www.nymex.com/refernce/notices/2001/ntm_191r.htm.

What do you think?  I have never been crazy about the Commercial Support tag myself.  Do you like professional services?  Or do you have another suggestion.  Please send me your comments within the next day or so.  I would like to get back to David Oxley soon.  Thanks.  --Sally

Subject:	Proposal to Change ""Commercial Support"" peer group label to ""Professional Services""

At the VP PRC meeting last Wednesday, Dave Delainey proposed we consider retitling the Commercial Support peer group as above. Apparently this suggestion was made and broadly supported at a policy committee meeting a few weeks ago. The suggestion is that the Support label is seen rather negatively across the organisation and the new label may be an improvement.

The VP PRC Committee resolved that they would be open to supporting a change, subject to the senior leads from across CS providing their views/support.

I volunteered to circulate this note to the 2 of you in EWS and ask my colleagues from HR to share with their CS leads to solicit their views before returning to the committee late next week with summarised reaction. Perhaps you would provide me with your views and a vote for or against? 

I would strongly recommend that we do broadly discuss this outside a small circle of people.

MEMORANDUM RE FIRST EXTRAORDINARY COMMITTEE SESSION

From:  Sandi McCubbin
            Mike Day

January 11, 2001

Note: This memo will supplement the committee analysis which you will
receive by separate fax.


ABX1-5 Keeley re the governance of the ISO and PX was discussed first.
A number of possible amendments were discussed by members.  Suggested
amendments included extending the term of members beyond one year,
increasing the number of members beyond 3, whether there should be
senate confirmation of ISO and PX board members, or at least voting
representation for the legislature on the Energy Oversight Board which
will approve the ISO/PX members.  There was also discussion of whether
FERC would approve of this new governance structure.   Another
discussion centered on whether the positions should be full time, as
opposed to part time, and how to define =01&affiliated=018 in conjunction w=
ith
the bill=01,s ban on members of the ISO and PX being affiliated with a
market participant.

Support for the bill:  Consumers Union, EOB on behalf of the
administration, CalPIRG, PX, TURN, UCAN, ORA, Coalition of Utility
Employees.

Opposition:  ISO, which raised issues regarding incompatibility with
FERC orders and concern that the bill would lead to lengthy litigation.
They suggested that if the ISO and PX boards were appointed solely by
the California governor that FERC would not find that legally sufficient
to be =01&independent=018.


ABX1-6 Dutra/Pescetti  addressed retained utility generation assets and
commission regulation of same.  The bill as written is merely a clean up
to clarify that the CPUC would retain jurisdiction over utility
generation after it is valued for purposes of calculating CTC=01*until and
unless the CPUC gives permission for the plant to be sold under Section
851.    The discussion evolved into a lengthy inquiry over the different
regulatory schemes for utility and non-utility generation.  Assemblyman
Leonard questioned whether it was efficient to have a market where a
portion of the generation was regulated and another portion
unregulated.  More and more members skirted the subject of attempting to
regulate the non-utility generators within the state.  In supporting
testimony, CPUC President Lynch essentially asked for jurisdiction over
such generators, stating that CPUC inspectors were denied access to an
AES plant at Redondo Beach for 9 hours during an ISO alert yesterday.
Chmn. Wright asked Lynch to assemble a list of the regulatory powers she
would seek.

In support:  CPUC, TURN, UCAN, CUE, PG&E, SCE

PG&E agreed with Lynch and also argued that the Legislature should
revisit the exemption regulation for marketers and non-utility
generators contained in Code section 216(I).   PG& also had suggested
technical amendments, which were not released, which dealt with
confirming that Section 367 still requires market valuation and that the
CPUC can set the ratemaking for such retained assets.

We have talked with the author about meeting with him after the
amendments are available.  No amendments were voted on for any of these
bills until they are brought up in the Senate.  Thus there was only
limited discussion of amendments.

SENT ON BEHALF OF MIKE BURKE

With your input, I developed the following documents (attached below) about 
six months ago.

EOTT Guiding Documents


EOTT Energy Strategies


EOTT Core Competencies & Company Strengths


With your continued help, what we now must do is to sharpen and focus our 
strategy and decide what we will select as the critical few core competencies 
of EOTT.  (Trying to be all these thing to everybody id tantamount to being 
nothing for anyone)  We must find the unique value that we alone can and will 
deliver to our chosen market.

As outlined in Michael Tracy's ""The Discipline of Market Leaders,"" our task 
is to define and develop three essential concepts.
1.  The value proposition:  The implicit promise EOTT will make to customers 
to deliver a particular combination of values, price, quality, performance, 
solution, convenience, etc.

2.  The Value driven operations model:  The right combination of operating 
processes, management systems, business structure, and culture that gives 
EOTT the capacity to deliver on its value proposition.

3.  Value discipline:  EOTT must choose one of the three value disciplines 
below on which to stake our market reputation.

Operational Excellence:  (Middle of the market products/services at the best 
price with the least inconvenience) or 
Product/Service/Leadership (the very best performance in product/service) or 
Customer Intimacy (selectively chosen customers/best solution for unique 
customer/customer intimacy)

I will provide the first draft of a much more focused and disciplined 
strategy in the next few days.  Your input is always welcome."

Briefly:

The hearing that was planned to focus on UC issues has been postponed, 
although per the attached there will be a discussion concerning the impact of 
Energy Service Providers turning their customers back to DWR/utility service.


Also, the Federal Judge has scheduled the UC/CSU - Enron Energy Services 
hearing for April 11th.  UC had requested an immediate review versus a 
procedural 35 days to schedule.  The schedule reflects a more procedural 
answer.  

More as we get information.

Subject: Thursday Hearing

Per Sandy, it sounds like there is going to be a budget committee hearing on 
Thursday to discuss DWR procurement and the effect of marketers returning 
customers to utility service.  It looks like we may be asked to provide 
testimony (but not about any customer specific issues).  Mike Day would be 
the right person to provide that testimony if needed.  I'll pass on any more 
details as I get them.  MDS

> All other options series in the expiring month will be subject to

> When submitting an E/A form, please note the following:
>
> (a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
> (b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
> are subject to automatic
> 	Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in strike
> prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
> (c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
> strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a
> position in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to
> notify Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have
> an officer available to confirm such intention.
> (d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
> to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.
>
> 3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM (""OPRR"") - As a general rule,
> purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
> If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
> position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
> expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your

> trades.
> The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
>
> 4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""H/C"") - H/C forms
> may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
> house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
> prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade
> entry system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department
> of COMEX (""Trade Audits"").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than
> 2:30 PM.
>
> 5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""Ex-Pit"") - Ex Pit forms may
> be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.
> Problem trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must
> be corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct
> supervision of Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later

>
> 	*****
> A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
> process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing
> Department:
> 1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
> report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
> based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
> CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
> close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
> adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
> gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for
> clearance on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR
> transactions which have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and
> trade information submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this
> report will also reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment
> instructions, the projected number of exercises and maximum potential
> assignments for each strike price, the type of exercise (manual or
> automatic), whether the strike is In, At or Out of the money, and the
> exercise value associated therewith based on settlement prices established
> by COMEX on the day of expiration.
>
> 2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
> expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
> day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
> Prior to 2:30 PM.
>
> Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report
> and transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether
> trades have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by
> COMEX's On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system.
>
> B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
> including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
> COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
> Clearing Department.
>
> C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
> Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.
>
> D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
> will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
> Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
> options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
> assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement
> carefully.  Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or
> more will be automatically exercised, not all short option positions will
> be assigned if there are any options manually abandoned at such strike
> prices.  Please note that there also may be some at or out-of-the money
> options being exercised.
>
> E)	At approximately 8:00 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
> available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.
>
> It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is

Ted,  Steve asked that I forward this information to a lawyer at Burlington, 
but couldn't recall the name.  Do you have any contact information for 
Burlington.  Thanks.

Gerald, It seems that the drafts that have been sent back to Marathon have 
confused the relationships of Marathon, Mariner and MEGS. As an example you 
have requested that the LOPSA rely on the O&M Agreement between Mariner and 
MEGS, which Marathon is not a party.  We would rather that agreement remain 
between MEGS and Mariner and be the basis for your resolution of disputes. 
The legal capacities presented in your response to the LOPSA draft are 
confusing. All rights seem to flow to MEGS, yet the obligations seem to be on 
Mariner, we do not believe the division of rights and obligations in this 
manner are a good situation. By example the Indemnity provisions have been 
altered to have Mariner indemnify the Owners and Operator (no mention of 
MEGS)and then further change the indemnity to a negligence based indemnity 
(of Platform Operator). The PHA is a unilateral indemnity to Platform 
Operator and Platform Owners and we must insist on this same level of 
protection with MEGS.
If you would like to make another attempt at either a ratification or LOPSA 
that addresses MEGS as Lessee and Mariner as its operator and provide for any 
resolution between those two in the O&M Agreement we would be happy to 
discuss this further. If you would like to go through the LOPSA line by line 
please call and we can set up a teleconference with our legal department to 
do so.

I have reviewed your response and disagree with the characterization of our
modification the documents. I would like to clarify our reasons for the
modifications to avoid any further miscommunications.

MEGS' alteration of the documents do not impair the protections afforded to
Marathon under the Production Handling Agreement.  Our modifications were
simply intended to allocate certain risks between MEGS and Mariner with
respect to Marathon (as operator of the South Pass 89 B Platform) as such
risks were intended to be allocated by MEGS and Mariner.  Mariner's
transfer of interest in the flowline to MEGS introduces a new party which
Marathon can look to for certain obligations with respect to the platform.
The alterations do not remove Mariner from its current role as operator and
maintainer of the flowline and owner of the hydrocarbons.  For these
reasons, I would disagree with your response that the draft alterations do
not provide the intended protections that Marathon would expect absent such
a transfer to MEGS.  Mariner still shoulders these risks and expenses under
the Production Handling Agreement.

Having MEGS fully ratify the Production Handling Agreement  and becoming
jointly and severally liable to Marathon is not appropriate.   MEGS does
not hold title to any hydrocarbon production or operate the facilities and
should not be liable for all risks and expenses associated therewith.
Mariner should continue to shoulder those risks and as before.

I would be happy to discuss your issues with our Platform Lease revisions
at your convenience or to discuss the above further.

Great--and I will be inspired with my draft of his remarks.

Rosie, could you call the phone number on the invitation, ask for Herb 
Bateman (he is the director), and tell him of the commitment?

I am out of town and do not have their number, and they called me wondering 
about Ken's decision last Friday.

Thanks,

Subject: Gathering Place Speaking Invitation

If you are inclined to accept this invitation, we could put together an 
interesting talk on the importance of good mental health to business with 
some national statistics and then segue into Enron's emphasis on wellness and 
having fun in the workplace.  Our strategy and experience will be very 
interesting to the group since it shows what a corporate leader is doing to 
become the employer of choice in the marketplace.

You could expect a full house (around 400) for the talk.  If it fits into 
your schedule, Jack Bowen said he would be delighted to be honorary chairman 
of the event.

- Rob

I think that this looks pretty good, and don't know if we could better the 
cost too much by looking around.  Cara, would you like for me to hold the 
reservation on my credit card?  Don't know how much baby stuff may be hitting 
yours, so I would be glad to do so.  

I am real comfortable with sharing the costs of this dinner, but don't 
necessarily feel that we have to split it in thirds.  This is a good year for 
me to cover a large portion of the cost - when we did the 40th anniversary 
party, David and I  were not in such good shape and I think that Cindy and 
Richard covered a lot of the costs.  Things ebb and flow - 2000 was a good 
year at Enron and this would be a good time for me to put some of my reward 
to good use.  --Sally

Ok--being the one that probably doesn't really have the dollars to do this I
would still say ""yes""----will try to make room on a credit card for
this--have until June so I think it is ok.....

Will call the picture lady tomorrow and see what the price would be for
that--will email you the results.

Hi, sistas-

Here's the scoop on the Josephine House:

We can reserve with just a credit card; no deposit required.

Parties under 20:  $200 room fee.  $50 valet parking fee.

I confirmed ""17"" with mom.

Heidi sent some sample menus.   A 3-course menu (appetizer or salad, entree,
dessert) is $45.
A 4-course (same as 3-course plus hors d'oeuvres) sample menu is $52.
Each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course.  The
food sounds really good.

So, here's a guess at cost:
17 people at $45 =  $765
Beverages =        $200
Gratuity =   $193
Valet =    $  50
Room rental =   $200
TOTAL   $1408, or $469 per family if we divide it into
thirds

What do you guys think?   Should we explore other options - or just go with
this?   I think Chris and I would be fine with this sort of cost - but
probably couldn't go crazy with gift and decorations too.  So, if we really
want to do the photo(s) - do we have a cost for these yet?, we may want to
consider other options.    Thoughts?   -cara

Ben has suggested that I may be able to help you with the ABB change order.  
If you have a change order template that you can send to me, I can get

If someone tries to nominate POI 61243 they will receive a message saying 
""Invalid point"".  The market service rep will then notify me because they 
cannot nominate on the point.  I will then notify Jan.  Jan and I will notify 
Sue, Morgan, Kent and yourself.  Let me know if we need to change anything.

Subject: Re: last year's deal  

Jan and  Linda, the issue is how does anyone know for last years base gas 
deal if it has ""gone physical"" (if Sempra nominates the SF agreement for 
delivery).  My answer subject to your verification is that the POI that they 
have to nominate to is flagged as not available, so when they nominate Market 
Services is aware of it and is to call Kent/Sue/Morgan.  Could you fill in 
any missing details.  Thanks, Dari

They nominate the SF to market services also, in addition to any transport 
they have?  Dari, please follow up on this with market services and verify 
what the procedures are and let us all know.    Again, this may relate to a 
counterproposal we make to TCEM if they barf on the corporate guarantee 
issue, so time is of the essence.  Thanks.  DF

addition to my first reply:

Also, Sempra does not nominate to Kent/Sue/Morgan.  They nominate to Market 
Services.  Sempra's scheduler would not even think to call any one of us.  We 
would only hope their deal maker, David Otte, would be in the loop on their 
side and notify one of us if they ever decided to go physical.

Rogers,

Enron Energy Services, Inc. (""EESI"") submitted application to become a NEPO=
OL member, to be effective January 1, 2000.  EESI was approved by the NEPOO=
L Participants Membership Subcommittee at its January 24, 2000 meeting.  On=
e requirement of NEPOOL membership is to satisfy the Financial Assurance Po=
licy for NEPOOL Members.  EESI, Enron Energy Marketing Corp, and Enron Powe=
r Marketing, Inc. are all members of NEPOOL and have chosen to satisfy the =
Financial Assurance Policy by issuance of Performance Bond(s), rather than =
corporate guaranty, due to Enron's disagreement with the Form of Corporate =
Guaranty required by NEPOOL.

EESI, via Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, issued a Performance Bond in th=
e amount of $8,000,000 in June 2000; the Performance Bond was reissued in J=
une 2001 in the amount of $8,000,000.  EESI received a letter from ISO New =
England dated October 10, 2001, addressed to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements)=
 and received by Becky probably October 12, 2001, indicating that EESI's cu=
rrent Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase th=
e amount to $11,703,018.75 to cover EESI's current activity level.  Becky d=
elivered the October 10th letter  to my attention whereby I took the letter=
 to EESI Legal Department (Karen Cordova) and informed Karen that EESI need=
ed to increase the Performance Bond to $20,000,000.  Karen requested Credit=
 Department (Nichole Gunter) initiate an increase in the Performance Bond t=
o the $20,000,000 level; to the best of my knowledge the initial conversati=
on with Credit Department was October 12, 2001.  In telephone conversations=
 with ISO-NE, Enron's Credit Department personnel were informed by ISO-NE t=
hat in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default the matter needed to be r=
esolved within ten (10) days of the date of the October 10, 2001 letter (Oc=
tober 19, 2001), however the letter did not indicate such.=20

I was notified by Credit Department on October 16, 2001 that the bond compa=
ny Enron utilizes for performance bond(s) would not process our Performance=
 Bond request for increase until Enron paid the bond company for outstandin=
g invoices for ""other"" performance bonds (bond  renewals), approximately $1=
50,000.  The ""other"" performance bond invioces had been bounced around EESI=
, since June 2001, to various individuals (i.e. Greg Sharp, Mark Mueller, J=
eff Golden, Scott Mills) and had still remained unpaid.  Payments for the ""=
other"" performance bonds were made and the bond company processed our reque=
st for increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to $20,000,000, which w=
as issued by the bond company on October 23, 2001, executed by EESI on Octo=
ber 23, 2001 and forwarded via FAX and Overnight Mail to ISO-NE on October =
23, 2001.  EESI was unable to comply with the October 19, 2001 deadline to =
resolve the Financial Assurance Default due to complications with the bond =
company as mentioned above.  Credit Department personnel informed ISO-NE pe=
rsonnel that EESI would not meet the October 19, 2001 deadline, but was wor=
king diligently to resolve the matter; Credit Department personnel sent via=
 FAX, a copy of the request to the bond company for revisions to the Perfor=
mance Bond to ISO-NE personnel on October 19, 2001. =20

I notified Dan Allegretti, (Enron Government Affairs & Chariman, NEPOOL Par=
ticipants Committee) of the entire situation prior to October 19, 2001.  Da=
n indicated that he did not think there would be any problems, but to get t=
he matter resolved as quickly as possible. Dan advised me that the implicat=
ions of the Financial Assurance Default would result in communications to t=
he Membership Subcommittee and that when the next letter was published, the=
 following month, EESI would no longer be listed as being in default.  On O=
ctober 19, 2001 another letter was sent to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements) f=
rom Edward McKenna, Vice President & Chief Financial Officer informing EESI=
 that ""Enron Energy Services, Inc. has not maintained the required level of=
 financial assurance for 10 days or more, and has had a total combination o=
f 3 financial assurance and/or payment defaults in the last 12 months, whic=
h qualifies them as having 2 (two) Level 1 defaults.  The ISO has been in c=
ontact with Enron Energy Services, Inc. through multiple telephone communic=
ations, and to date the financial assuvance default has not been cured.  Th=
erefore, per the established procedure, we are forwarding this information =
to the NEPOOL Membership Subcommittee for action by them.""  According to Da=
n Allegretti the Memberhsip Subcommittee reports to him, as Chariman of the=
 Members Subcommittee, and he would discuss the issue with them.  The previ=
ous two Financial Assurance Defaults mentioned the October 19, 2001 letter =
occurred (i) December 2000, when payment was received 1-2 days late and was=
 automatically resolved when payment was received and (ii) September 2001, =
when Financial Assurance Default occurred and was resolved through market a=
ctivity.  To the best of my knowledge, EESI was unaware of either the Decem=
ber 2000 Payment Default or the September 2001 Financial Assurance Default,=
 and no information was received by EESI from ISO-NE relative to either inc=
idence.

According to (i) Protocal for the Initation of Membership Termination Proce=
edings and (ii) conversations with Dan Allegretti, the issue should be reso=
lved with the receipt on October 24, 2001 of the Performance Bond by ISO-NE=
.  I have also advised the ISO-NE, in the future, to send communications to=

Hey Gang,

It looks like we finally have a date to talk with some folks at EBS about 
commercial opportunities. Since scheduling a meeting has been exceedingly 
difficult,,
I've decided to settle for a conference  call. I hope you are available this 
Wednesday, May 3, 2000 at 3pm Houston time to speak with Matt Harris and some 
broadband folks.  If you can't make it don't sweat it but if you can that 
would be great!  The call should take no more than 1 1/2hrs.  Dial in 
instructions are as follows: 

1-800-998-2462  PIN Code 4139211

Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget.  
Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are 
appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I 
split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had 
discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units 
and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the 
accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs, 
specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units 
eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, 
outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for 
specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  I look at this 
cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business 
and evaluate/manage our risks.

Wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for 
each group with these changes.



Regards
Delainey"

For all of you who are active participants in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, 
we have made arrangements with Northern Trust, our Plan Administrator, to 
expedite any loan requests made during the week of June 18 - June 29 in order 
to help you during this recovery period from any flood damage you may have 
experienced.

If you do not already have an outstanding loan, you can request up to 50% of 
your balance up to a maximum of $50,000.  To request a loan follow these 
three easy steps in order to ensure quick processing:

 1. Log onto the website:   https://www4.rsweb.com/61045/# or call the 
Benefits Service Center at 713.853.7979.

 2. Enter your SSN and your Personal Identification Number and click on ""Loan 
Information"" to see the amount available.
 If you wish to request a loan, click on ""Loan Modeling/Request"" and follow 
the instructions.

 3. Checks will be mailed from Northern Trust in Chicago  on June 27 for 
loans requested the week of June 18 - June 22  and on July 5 for loans 
requested June 25 - June 29. 

NOTE:  The IRS restricts Hardship Withdrawals to specific circumstances 
outlined in the Money-in-Motion guide on the benefits website.  
Unfortunately, while we know the flood has imposed hardships on many of you, 
these circumstances do not qualify for a withdrawal.

UPDATE FROM EBS OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN

Since its inception just two years ago, Enron Broadband Services has made=
=20
significant progress toward achieving our ambitious goals of being the=20
leading=20
provider of premium broadband content and the largest buyer and seller of=
=20
bandwidth on a global basis.  We are extremely proud of the company=01,s=20
accomplishments and equally optimistic about the future of EBS.

The market for bandwidth intermediation and risk management is developing=
=20
more quickly than anticipated =01) faster than the markets for natural gas =
or=20
even=20
electricity had developed.  Global Trading and Risk Management has already=
=20
executed more than 600 transactions this year, far exceeding the 321 total=
=20
transactions executed in 2000. The Enron Intelligent Network (EIN), with
its first-of-a-kind pooling point infrastructure, is in place to provide th=
e=20
physical=20
backbone and switching platform to support EBS=01, emerging bandwidth and=
=20
related trading operations.

Likewise, EBS has developed a superior technical and commercial platform to=
=20
digitally deliver entertainment on-demand.  While we have terminated our=20
relationship with Blockbuster because of their inability to secure content,=
=20
we=20
remain confident that EBS will be successful in independently acquiring=20
content=20
commitments and developing distribution partnerships for this exciting new=
=20
business.

EBS will continue to evolve as we build upon our presence in the bandwidth =
and
network services market.  While the market for broadband services in the U.=
S.=20
and globally has undergone significant change in recent months, the demand=
=20
for=20
broadband services continues to grow dramatically and EBS has the skills an=
d=20
strategy required to be successful long term.

To better focus our efforts and respond to the market, we have made some=20
organizational changes to enable us to effectively execute our strategy and=
=20
efficiently grow EBS.  These changes are outlined below and a current=20
organizational chart is attached.

David Cox, formerly Managing Director of Content Origination, has been name=
d=20
Chief Commercial Officer, reporting to the EBS office of the chair.  This n=
ew=20
role=20
will enable David to share his broad origination expertise with the various=
=20
EBS=20
commercial teams.

Digital Content Services, formerly Content Origination, is now led by Frank=
=20
Bay=20
with Rich DiMichele and Ed Smida.  Rich will focus on the development of th=
e=20
content risk management business.

Stewart Seeligson is now leading an expanded Wholesale Origination unit=20
combining=20
media transport opportunities that Stewart has been developing in the=20
broadcast=20
industry and opportunities that Ted Seitz has been pursuing with traditiona=
l=20
carriers,=20
ISPs, and network service providers.  This new origination team will focus =
on=20
executing highly structured transactions with significant value in the=20
wholesale market.

John Echols now leads the Enterprise Origination unit with Jim Crowder, Mat=
t=20
Harris,=20
and Brad Nebergall.  Bryan Burnett also has joined the Enterprise team from=
=20
Enron=20
North America=01,s Industrial Markets group.  John=01,s group will focus on=
=20
intermediation=20
opportunities with technology, financial, and corporate customers.

Dale Surbey has joined EBS from Enron North America to lead the Structuring=
=20
group. =20
Brad Richter will move to Jeff Donahue=01,s Corporate Development team to p=
ursue=20
M&A and large, structured transaction opportunities.

Joe Edwards is leading the newly formed North American middle markets group=
,=20
reporting to Paul Racicot.

Daryl Dunbar has joined EBS as a vice president in Engineering focusing on =
IP=20
engineering.  David Leatherwood and his team have moved to Enron Energy=20
Services to develop outsourcing opportunities related to network engineerin=
g=20
and construction.

We have established an impressive foundation from which to build our=20
business,=20
and look forward to executing on the tremendous opportunities we see in thi=
s=20
rapidly evolving market.

EBS WELCOMES NEW EMPLOYEES
Please welcome the following new employees to EBS:

Starcom voices interest, though industry remains skeptical=20
Enron Media Services has piqued the interest of Starcom North America with=
=20
its plans to=20
create a futures market for buying and selling media time and space.

In a recent letter to Starcom's clients, CEO Renetta McCann said the=20
Chicago-based media=20
company was in talks with Enron to examine the possibility of a deal.

""Despite what has been a negative reaction thus far from the industry, we=
=20
find Enron's plan=20
intriguing,"" McCann wrote. ""Clearly, Enron proposes breaking the rules of h=
ow=20
media can be=20
bought and sold.""

Last year, Enron Corp., the $30 billion financial risk management company=
=20
previously associated=20
with the energy industry, created EMS to market ""price-risk management"" pla=
ns=20
to advertisers=20
and media-service companies. In addition, Houston-based Enron seeks to=20
execute $1 billion in media=20
buys by year's end, though a representative declined to release information=
=20
about any possible deals.

In this volatile economy, marketers and media agencies could use Enron's=20
ability to hedge the risk=20
of media costs as far as five years ahead, said Edward Ondarza, a vp for EM=
S.=20

Up to this point, the only way marketers could cushion risk is by ""buying=
=20
forward"" via the upfront,=20
he added. ""We want to create a year-round upfront by developing a media=20
exchange [between=20
advertisers, media agencies and networks],"" he said.

Despite Enron's pitch, Starcom has received little feedback to the letter=
=20
from its clients, said Kevin=20
Gallagher, vp and director of local investments for Starcom, which claims=
=20
$4.3 billion in billings=20
and has clients such as General Motors and Kraft. ""We're always open to new=
=20
ways of doing=20
business, and we wanted to keep our clients apprised of what's going on,"" h=
e=20
said. ""But we are=20
not engaged in any business with Enron. It was and remains merely=20
exploratory.""

Many industry insiders remain skeptical of Enron's business model, because =
of=20
possible legal issues=20
and the novelty of the concept. But they acknowledge that eventually Enron'=
s=20
approach will become=20
commonplace.

""In theory it's great, but the practice is more difficult,"" said Jon Mandel=
,=20
MediaCom chief negotiating=20
officer. ""There are some big issues that need to be worked out.""

In the first quarter, Enron Broadband Services transacted seven times the=
=20
amount of bandwidth than it had in=20
the previous quarter, the unit of energy giant Enron Corp. announced=20
Tuesday. =20

The subsidiary showed a loss of $35-million in the quarter on revenues of=
=20
$83-million, the results being=20
attributed to the buildout of its fiber network and pooling points.

President and CEO Jeffrey Skilling said the broadband unit closed 580=20
transactions in the quarter, more than=20
double the level of the previous quarter. More impressive was the seven-fol=
d=20
increase in transacted bandwidth=20
this quarter: 43,400 Terabytes versus 6,005 Terabytes in the fourth quarter=
. =20
Enron is =01&making excellent=20
progress in creating a commodity market,=018 Skilling said. =20

Seventy new broadband customers were added in the quarter, for a total of=
=20
120.  Of that number 70%=20
of the customers are carriers or network service providers, a spokeswoman=
=20
told BMR, adding that half of=20
the deals done in the quarter were with that group.



Bandwidth intermediation/trading was the other key driver, with 580=20
transactions posted during the=20
quarter, a significant ramp-up from 232 reported 4Q:00 and 320 for all of=
=20
2000. In our view, we are=20
way past the question =01&Can bandwidth be commoditized?=018 and are enteri=

period of rapid=20
growth in commodity volumes which precedes the all-important emergence of=
=20
profitability.  In the=20
energy commodity markets, particularly natural gas and power in both the=20
United States and=20
Europe, the commodity volume growth phase lasted 1-3 years before=20
profitability emerged. We=20
see no reason for the bandwidth commodity market, which from a commodity=20
perspective =01&looks,=20
acts and feels=018 like electricity and natural gas, to perform any differe=
ntly=20
from these commodities.=20
We are entering Year 2 of the period of rapid volume growth. The next=20
catalyst in our view, will=20
be for Enron to announce a reasonably =01&date certain=018 for profitabilit=
y, much=20
in the same manner=20
as they did for Enron Energy Services several years ago. We think that date=

could be late 2002=20
or early 2003.

Excerpts:

...Enron's vice president and broadband trader, Paul Racicot, says Enron=20
alone could enter into 2,000=20
trades this year, but some analysts don't expect volumes to reach much more=
=20
than that in the entire market.=20
And while liquidity on such major routes as Los Angeles/New York and New=20
York/Miami will improve=20
substantially, 2001 will likely be remembered as the year progress was made=
=20
on issues whose resolution=20
was critical to the long-term health of the market.

...Probably the best-known proposal to promote network connectivity in the=
=20
context of the emerging=20
broadband trading market is Enron's =01&pooling points=018 initiative. Thes=
e=20
pooling points, or switching and=20
interconnection facilities through which connections between buyers and=20
sellers can be established, have=20
become so controversial that Enron seems almost apologetic about its plans =
to=20
add 14 new points this year.

=01&We plan on expanding the number of pooling points from 21 to 35 this ye=
ar,=018=20
says Paul Racicot, vice=20
president of bandwidth trading at Enron. =01&But we'll trade anywhere, thou=
gh,=018=20
he added.

Racicot is sensitive to criticism that behind Enron's pooling points is an=
=20
effort to control the broadband=20
market information flow.  =01&Enron's goal is to promote connectivity, not =
to=20
use pooling points as means=20
of gaining access to information about trading flows,=018 he says. =01&The =
purpose=20
of pooling points is to improve=20
market liquidity for broadband trading. The importance of this cannot be=20
overstated. A very high degree of=20
connectivity will be needed for a deep and liquid broadband-trading market =
to=20
be established.=018

According to Racicot, connectivity will develop rapidly this year =01* spur=
red=20
not just by Enron, but also by
third-party developers.

It looks to me from reviewing the bid documents we received on the January I to I deals like we communicated to the counterparties identical information that the capacity would be available in several ""packages"" and other details of the sale procedure.   That communication must have been either (1) a posting of some type, (2) a fax or other document we sent them explaining what space was available and how to bid, or (3) a script that the marketers were all following to communicate to the customers.   Toby, if it was a posting, it would have gone up in late December or the first few days of January.  Please verify whether we did any open season posting advertising that space (which included Dec. 01 space and calendar '02 and '03 space).  If it was a fax or other document or a script, we need to get our hands on it.  Kevin, Lorraine, TK, Susan--does anyone remember which it was or know how to get our hands on it?  

If we are going to be in a dogfight with BP on these deals, lets make sure we go in armed with as much of the relevant information as possible to demonstrate we were following the rules.  DF "

Is this proprietary data from Goldman or is it data which is already available in the market, i.e. via CEPI? Thanks.

Pulp Update: Inventory Rise in July Well Below Average; Goldman Sachs High
Yield Research; 8/14/01

Norscan pulp inventories rose just 4,000 tonnes in July, which is well below
the typical seasonal increase of approximately 150,000 tonnes.  Amidst all
the bad news about the pulp environment, this is good news.  Producer
downtime is certainly helping.  However, pulp prices remain quite weak, and
inventories of 1.78 million tonnes are still too high to allow for any
tightening of supply and demand in the short term.

We will distribute details of the July pulp report once they are available.

Just met w/ Skilling and Whalley. 

Var for gas has temp increase of $15MM until next friday (12/15/2000).
Jeff is calling for an executive comm mtg to ask for an additional $40 MM of 
corp var until next wed (12/13/2000).

One issue is UK power will be over VAR everyday starting probably thurs or 
fri of this week, unless we increase them as well. (They sweep retail deals 
into book once a week on this day). This increase only needs to be $2-3- 
million.

Fasten seat belts and apply oxygen masks.

I have attached the 2002 headcount template that was completed for Corporate back in June.  Please update this template to reflect your latest 2002 headcount information.

this announcement has not gone out for that reason.  we have had a number of 
discussions about it since this was drafted and there seems to be some 
concern about it being inside one of the business units since it is supposed 
to handle investments across the company and would be bringing the EBS assets 
with it.  your suggestion that it might report to andy has some merit, but 
there may be other options.  what would you think if we established an 
investment committee consisting of me, rice, and delainey and made garland 
responsible to that group.  we would have all of the relevent business units 
represented and the p&l would ultimately be allocated to the one in which the 
investment originated.  do you think that would work?  it might go a long way 
to satisfying all constituents.

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Wholesale Restructuring Group will also become part of Enron Principal 
Investments.  The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work 
with the all the business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage 
equity investments, which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary 
knowledge.   These investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, 
traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director of Enron Principal Investments, 
overseeing all of its activities.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Richard 
Lydecker, and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new 
investments unit.

This new investment unit will report to Greg Whalley, in his capacity as an 
Enron Policy Committee member.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Richard and the other members of this group 
in this effort.

Jeff Skilling

Subject:	2001 Andersen Audits

Attached below are the 2001 Andersen business audits and the timeline for these audits and other work. Within this document, we have identified the EES owner(s) that will be involved in each business audit. The scope/objectives of each business audit have also been outlined.

Business Audit Approach
For each business audit, we plan to hold an opening and closing meeting with all key personnel involved for that project (includes business owners, CAO, EAS representative, and Andersen). The objectives of the opening meeting are to discuss specific audit areas, team members, key contacts, and to identify required EES documentation. The closing meeting will be critical as this is the final opportunity to ensure all facts surrounding any issues are agreed upon and initially discuss any action plans. Timing of the opening/closing meetings will be communicated by Andersen at a later date.

Please review the attached Andersen document to ensure the business owners have been properly identified. Please contact me with any revisions or other questions.

Thanks,
Misty

Calif Probe Focuses On Dynegy,Mirant Plants-Commissioners    =20
Updated: Monday, May 21, 2001 05:28 PM=01;ET     =01;=20
=01;
By Jason Leopold and Mark Golden=20

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California officials are focusing an investigation=
=20
into the state's wholesale electricity markets on two power plants operated=
=20
by two of the state's largest merchant power companies, Mirant Corp. (MIR,=
=20
news, msgs) and a joint venture between Dynegy Inc. (DYN, news, msgs) and N=
RG=20
Energy (NRG, news, msgs), according to two commissioners on the California=
=20
Public Utilities Commission.=20

The CPUC and the state Attorney General are investigating whether output wa=
s=20
withheld in order to maintain high prices over the past seven months at=20
Mirant's Pittsburg plant in northern California and the Encina power plant,=
=20
which is equally owned by Dynegy and NRG, near San Diego.=20

All power plants in the state are being examined, but investigators have=20
found that the Encina and Pittsburg plants have reduced power during supply=
=20
shortages, causing market prices to rise.=20

But so far, the commissioners said, investigators have found no activity th=
at=20
is clearly illegal.=20

""Is it unethical? Yes,"" one PUC commissioner said. ""But is it illegal? No,=
=20
unless there was collusion. This is the system we set up. What the generato=
rs=20
are doing would be the appropriate thing to do if you are going to maximize=
=20
your profit to shareholders.""=20

Spokesmen for Mirant and Dynegy flatly denied the charges.=20

""What we did was both legal and ethical,"" said Mirant spokesman Chuck=20
Griffin. ""There was a very forthright attempt to keep these plants up and=
=20
running. Unequivocally, we have never held anything back.""=20

Some of the turbines at the Encina plant are peaking units, which are=20
supposed to ramp up and down to meet demand, Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel=
l=20
said. The plant is operated by NRG, but Dynegy markets the power from the=
=20
plant and tells NRG how much power to generate based on what has been sold.=
=20

""We've done absolutely nothing to manipulate prices,"" Stengell said.=20
""Electricity demand increases and decreases throughout the day. Our=20
production increases and decreases to follow changing demand. Ultimately, t=
he=20
ISO determines the exact amount of dispatch.""=20

A spokesman for Attorney General William Lockyer declined to comment on the=
=20
ongoing investigation.=20

CPUC President Loretta Lynch told California newspapers last week that her=
=20
office and that of Lockyer's have enough information to take legal action=
=20
against generators next month, though she declined to name the companies=20
involved and she said that the exact nature of the legal action is still=20
under review.=20

""We get really tired of these assertions with no evidence to back them up,""=
=20
Griffin said. ""This whole idea that any generation was held back at any tim=
e=20
is completely bogus. It is pure political rhetoric.""=20

Mirant's California power plants have run at full power during critical tim=
es=20
except under one of two conditions, Griffin said. Either generating units=
=20
were broken and had to be taken off line to be fixed, or they were beginnin=
g=20
to run in a way that violated environmental restrictions and Mirant had to=
=20
get permission to run at full power any longer.=20

""There are no other reasons than those two,"" said Griffin.=20

Nevertheless, several employees at the power plants involved have testified=
=20
that generating units were ramped down even when the state's Independent=20
System Operator had warned of tight supplies, according to one commissioner=
.=20

And a senior NRG employee at the Encina power plant in Carlsbad told Dow=20
Jones Newswires that he was told by Dynegy's Houston trading floor to ""ramp=
=20
down"" the large 951-megawatt plant on at least 10 occasions when he knew=20
power supplies were tight.=20

""We would be told to ramp down the units even when we knew the state needed=
=20
the megawatts,"" the employee said. ""Then the spot price would go up, but we=
=20
didn't really pay too much attention to that, because as far as we know=20
everybody was doing this. We knew how much power other plants were operatin=
g=20
at, and we knew they weren't at full capacity.""=20

NRG spokeswoman Meredith Moore said that the ISO gives instructions to Dyne=
gy=20
and Dynegy tells NRG what to do. ""And there have been conditions when the I=
SO=20
told us to ramp down during Stage 2 emergencies,"" Moore said.=20

Also, one CPUC commissioner pointed out that the state's deregulation law=
=20
doesn't require owners of power plants to bid all of their capacity into th=
e=20
market.=20

The state's incumbent utilities, who were forced to sell their power plants=
=20
as part of deregulation, also may have contributed to the problem, accordin=
g=20
to an ISO study. By not securing nearly enough power in advance to meet the=
ir=20
customers projected needs, the state's three main utilities contributed to =
36=20
Stage 1 and 2 power emergencies last summer and forced the grid operator to=
=20
pay a much higher price to keep the lights on.=20

The utilities argued that they underscheduled their load so they wouldn't=
=20
have to pay the generators' high bid prices. The ISO market last year had a=
=20
price cap, while other markets did not.=20

Mirant's Griffin, meanwhile, said all the finger pointing isn't solving the=
=20
state's problem.=20

""If they are going to get to a solution in California, they have to get=20
beyond silly political rhetoric,"" Griffin said. ""The real solution to the=
=20
problem is to get new supply, and if they are going to do that they have to=
=20
make this market look attractive to the kind of people who can build power=
=20
plants.""=20

hamburgers, hotdogs, chips and cotton candy, as well as usual concessions.
Commemorative Millennium Season 2000 T-shirts will be on sale for $12.00.
These shirts will include both flag and tackle team names on the back.
Don=01,t be left out, get your T-shirt early.

Season Programs will be on sale for $3.00.  The program includes each team
=01,s roster listing the players=01, name, jersey number and school.  The

be useful for the entire season.  To help defer the $3.00 price,
Fuddrucker's has included a 10% discount card with each program good
throughout the football season.  We also thank Diamond Kuts and Sports
Clips for their advertisements.

Players, now is your chance to get back at your coaches.  There will be
Dunking Booths with each Team=01,s coaches taking their turn to be your
target.  Come by for a chance to throw the football and send them under.
Your coaches will be in the Dunking Booths following your game.  Please
plan to stick around for an additional hour following your game.  This
will allow you to enjoy all of these activities as well as watching your
opponents play.

All proceeds from the days activities will be used exclusively for the
SBMSA Football Program.  Contact your Coaches if you have any questions.

Looking forward to the new season!

Bruce MacLeod at Hennigan's firm has informed me that plaintiffs will NOT file
a summary judgment motion against ECT Securities.

Also, next week Ralph Hellmold will be deposed on 6/13 and 6/14, but we will
not be expected to produce McGrath until July.

Question:  Do we want to pay McGrath to attend Hellmold's deposition on 6/13
and 6/14 to help me out (and maybe keep Hellmold a little more honest by his
presence in the room)?

Recruiting Roundup

The big Longhorn recruiting weekend this year will be Dec. 15-17 and will b=
e
built around the annual football banquet.
Nearly all of the 19 recruits who have already committed to Texas have chos=
en
that weekend to visit, and so have most of the players the Longhorns are
still recruiting.
The list of players the Longhorns are still seriously recruiting is
continuing to shrink.
At this point, there are 10 recruits left on the board who (a) have offers =
or
will get offers if they check out okay academically, and (b) are strongly
considering the Longhorns.
They are DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison, LB Derrick Johnson of Waco, D=
L
Kaelen Jakes of Valencia, Cal.; TE James Moses and DE Jonathan Jackson, bot=
h
of Galena Park North Shore; OL Jamie Hightower of Jacksonville, OL William
Winston of Houston Madison, safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple, athlete Quan
Cosby of Mart and DT Paul Broussard of Blinn JC.
Most of the remaining six or seven scholarships will go to the players in
that group.
Johnson, Jakes, Moses, Jackson and Brandon all list Texas No. 1 at this
point, and it is possible the Longhorns will get all five of them.
Winston also says Texas is tops with him right now, but he also wants to lo=
ok
at several out-of-state schools.
Harris is the remaining recruit who is No. 1 on my wish list, for two
excellent reasons. First, he is the top DT prospect in the country. Second,
he is the only top DT who is considering the Longhorns.
But Oklahoma is making a big run at him, and he is listening. He also is
being heavily recruited by Florida State and he plans to visit the Seminole=
s
this weekend.
Harris earlier listed Texas No. 1, but now says the Sooners and Seminoles a=
re
his top two teams.
He plans to visit Texas the Dec. 15 weekend, and has another trip set up to
Texas A&M the Dec. 8 weekend.
There actually is another top DT who is interested in Texas =01) Broussard =
=01) but
he has many academic hurdles to clear.
Jakes has already visited Texas, and the other nine players in that 10-man
grouping all say they plan to visit Texas the Dec. 15 weekend unless their
teams are still in the high school playoffs.
Their teams will have to be really good to be still in the playoffs at that
point because that will be the weekend of the state semifinals in some
classes and the finals in other classes.
There are some other great prospects who are  long shots, but are still in
the picture. They are headed by DT Marquise Hill, 6-6, 300, 5.0, of New
Orleans De La Salle, and DE Justin Tomerlin, 6-7, 260, of San Clemente, Cal=
.
Tomerlin has been committed to Florida State for several weeks, but now say=
s
he wants to visit several other schools, including Texas. He says he still =
is
committed to FSU. I'm not sure he will visit, but, if he does, there is a
chance.
Hill says he will take an official visit to  Texas the Thanksgiving weekend
and will attend the Texas-A&M game.
Hill has already visited LSU and plans to visit Michigan the Dec. 1 weekend=
,
Georgia the Dec. 8 weekend and Georgia Tech the Dec. 15 weekend.
He said his big three are Michigan, LSU and Texas.

Here's a list of the Horns' 19 early commitments:
Offensive Line (7)
Jonathan Scott, 6-7, 290, 4.9, Dallas Carter
Abe Robinson, 6-6, 270, 4.9, Jersey Village
Alfio Randall, 6-6, 300, 5.1, Blinn JC
Mike Garcia, 6-5, 280, 5.2, Galena Park
Will Allen, 6-5, 300, 5.2, Cypress Falls
Roman Reeves, 6-6, 295, 5.2, Livingston
Terrance Young, 6-6, 340, 5.5, Longview
Quarterback (1)
Matt Nordgren, 6-5, 225, 4.6, Dallas B. Lynch
Running Back (2)
Cedric Benson, 5-11, 200, 4.5, Midland Lee
Anthony Johnson, 5-11, 195, 4.4, Jefferson
Defensive End (1)
Eric Hall, 6-2, 240, 4.5, Clarksville, Tenn.
Linebacker (2)
Yamil LeBron, 6-2, 240, 4.7, Killeen Ellison
Lance McFarland, 6-1, 225, 4.6, Jefferson
Defensive Back (5)
Cedric Griffin, 6-1, 180, 4.4, San Antonio Holmes
Aaron Ross, 6-1, 182, 4.42, Tyler
Kendal Briles, 5-10, 175, 4.5, Wolfforth Frenship
Braden Johnson, 6-2, 200, 4.5, Euless Trinity
Brian Carter, 5-11, 180, 4.5, The Woodlands
Punter (1)
Brian Bradford, 6-1, 205, Trinity Valley JC

The Bowl Picture

If the Longhorns defeat Texas A&M on the Friday after Thanksgiving, they wi=
ll
wind up in the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, the Holiday Bowl in San Diego or the
Alamo Bowl in San Antonio.
Those three bowls get the top three picks from the Big 12, in that order,
after the BCS takes the league champion.
Conventional wisdom holds that Texas and the Cotton Bowl won't hook up agai=
n
because the Longhorns have already played there on two consecutive New Year=
's
Days.
But don't be too sure. The Cotton Bowl brass likes the Longhorns and Texas
coach Mack Brown loves New Year's Day bowls.
If that doesn't come to pass, then it will be either the Holiday or Alamo
bowl for the Longhorns.
What if Texas loses to Texas A&M? I hate to consider the unthinkable, and I
won't until and unless that happens.
But if it does, we'll all need to do some research on the Insight.com Bowl,
the Independence Bowl and maybe the Gallery.furniture.com Bowl.

UT Women Impressive

Sophomore guard Tai Dillard scored a career-high 17 points and led three
Longhorns in double-figure scoring as Texas captured a 71-47 victory over
Tulane Sunday at the Erwin center in the second round of the 2000 Preseason
Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT).
With the win, Texas (2-0) advances to the Preseason WNIT semifinal and
championship rounds next Sunday and Monday, at a site to be determined.
Texas joins No. 9 Louisiana Tech and No. 15 Virginia in the four-team
semifinals. No. 4 Purdue hosts Georgetown today (Monday) in the final game =
to
determine the fourth semifinalist.
The Preseason WNIT semifinal pairings will be: Texas versus the
Purdue-Georgetown winner, and Louisiana Tech versus Virginia.
The Preason WNIT committee has announced that if Purdue defeats Georgetown,
then the Boilermakers will serve as the host school for the Preseason WNIT
semifinals Sunday and third-place and championship games Monday in West
Lafayette, Indiana.
If Georgetown upsets Purdue, then the Preseason WNIT semifinals and
championship round will be hosted by Texas at the Erwin Center. The site an=
d
times will be announced late Monday.
Joining Dillard in double-figure scoring were junior forward Tracy Cook, wh=
o
tallied 12 points and senior guard JoRuth Woods, who chipped in with 11
points.
Woods added a team-high seven rebounds and had five assists, which tied her
best career night total.
Texas shot 43.5 percent from the floor (27-of-62), while the Green Wave (1-=
1)
hit 41.3 percent of their shots (19-for-46).
Texas shot 50% from the field in the first half en route to a 36-22 lead in
the win over Tulane.
Tulane turned the ball over 26 times, while UT committed 15 turnovers.
The Horns also held an advantage in steals (14 to nine), while Tulane
out-rebounded Texas, 38-37. UT also scored 27 points off turnovers to
Tulane's 10.
Texas had advanced to the WNIT second round with Friday's 72-47 win over
Wichita State, while Tulane bested Grambling State, 92-64, in the first
round.
Woods had 16 points and Cook  added 14 points in the victory over Wichita
State in the season opener for both squads.
The Longhorns, who never trailed in the game, were aided by an outstanding
22-for-26 effort from the free throw line, as they hit 84.6 percent of thei=
r
foul shots.
The Longhorns also shot 53.3 percent from the floor and outscored the
Shockers 34-14 in the paint.
Wichita State was held to a 29.2 percent shooting performance, as the
Shockers hit just 14 of 48  shots. WSU also turned the ball over 27 times,
while UT committed 21 turnovers.
Also scoring in double figures against Wichita State were Dillard, who had =
13
points, and freshman forward Stacy Stephens, who had 13 points, a game-high
eight rebounds and had a game-high seven steals in her first game as a
Longhorn.
In both their games, the Longhorns have shown much better quickness and
athleticism as a team than they showed last season.
""This was a good first outing for us,"" Conradt said. ""We wanted to have a
strong effort on the defensive end of the floor, and we succeeded.""
""We are starting and playing a lot of young people"" she said, ""and at this
point in time I think we have the athletic ability, the quickness and the
depth to play solid defense and press.""
""Success starts with defense, and we were really good again today on ""D"",""
Conradt added. ""We came out with excellent intensity on defense, and it
helped that we started off shooting strongly.""
""As we look ahead to the WNIT semifinals and if Purdue wins against
Georgetown, then we'll be playing on the road in West Lafayette,"" Conradt
said.
""If we do go on the road, I think we all welcome the opportunity to see how
we stack up against a top 10 team, and how we handle the pressure of being
away from Austin.""

True Orange Observations

I think it is time for the Texas Athletic Department to do some major soul
searching about the way it treats Longhorn football fans.
This season has set a modern day record for callous treatment of some of th=
e
most loyal fans in all of college football.
First, there was that unconscionable 11 a.m. kickoff of the
Lousiana-Lafayette game in early
September and then another 11 a.m. kickoff for the Oklahoma game.
I know some older Longhorn fans who had to miss the Louisiana-Lafayette gam=
e
because their doctors told them it would be hazardous to their health to
attend because they would be exposed to a potentially deadly combination of
extreme heat and three to four solid hours of blazing sunlight beaming down
on them.
Both those games were on TV and that is always the excuse UT athletic
officials come up with when kickoff times are inconvenient.
Most of us go along with things like that because nearly all of our games a=
re
televised. Last season, 12 of the 14 were on TV.
But three games this season aren't being televised and two of them =01)
Colorado and Kansas =01) are the longest road trips the Longhorns have in B=
ig 12
Conference play.
The game in Colorado was nixed to allow Texas A&M at Baylor to be televised=
,
and the Kansas game this Saturday won't be televised so the Iowa State at
Colorado game can be aired.
I know the TV folks don't worry about fan inconvenience, but UT athletic
officials certainly should and one thing they should include in the deal if
they decide to inconvenience their fans with 11 a.m. kickoffs in early
September heat is assurance that the two longest road trips on the conferen=
ce
schedule won't be nixed for TV.
One subscriber who couldn't attend the La-La game because of his doctor's
orders told me Athletic Director Deloss Dodds should sit outside in the hea=
t
with the regular fans and he wouldn't ever have another 11 a.m. kickoff for=
 a
Sept. 9 game.
I think most fans are willing to accept some inconvenience, but I think the=
y
expect some sort of a trade off.
In other words, if we need to have some early games for TV, then we should
get preference on the TV for the faraway games, especially when they go up
against the likes of A&M at Baylor and Iowa State at Colorado.
It wouldn't have been a hard sell. But apparently no one in the UT Athletic
Department thought enough of the fans to ask for a quid pro quo.
Let's hope they do next year. After all, it takes pretty loyal fans to sell
out big stadiums Saturday after Saturday when their team hasn't finished in
the top 10 in 17 long years.

Horns Sign Fine Baseball Class

Texas baseball coach Augie Garrido has signed 12 of the top high school
players in Texas and throughout the country.
""Through the hard work of recruiting coordinator Tommy Harmon, Frank Anders=
on
and the entire baseball staff, we have once again been able to sign a
tremendous recruiting class for next season,"" Garrido said.
""This group includes some of the top prospects in the state and will help u=
s
maintain this program's tradition of excellence,"" he added.
The signees included right-handed pitchers Luis Cortez of Sinton, Joey
Guajardo of Round Rock and Donald Levinski of Weimar.
Cortez, who ranks fifth in his class academically, posted a 0.82 ERA last
season and averaged two strikeouts per inning en route to being named the
District 30-3A Junior of the Year.
Guajardo went 11-2 on the mound for Round Rock High School during the 2000
campaign and was chosen Central Texas Player of the Year after boasting a
0.91 ERA, recording 172 strikeouts over 85 innings of work and pitching fou=
r
no-hitters.
Levinski led Weimar to the Class AA State Championship last year and earned
All-State accolades after registering a 14-1 record, an 0.70 ERA and 170
strikeouts over 95 innings of work.
Joining that trio is shortstop Michael Hollimon of Dallas Jesuit who batted
.373 last year with seven triples and was rated the 10th best prospect at
this year's Area Code Games, plus two right-handed pitcherswho also double =
as
shortstops. They are Kole Strayhorn of Shawnee, Okla., who posted an 8-1
record with a 0.97 ERA and 99 strikeouts over 60 innings, and Huston Street
of Austin Westlake, who not only earned second team All-Centex honors as a
pitcher with a 6-1 record and a 1.27 ERA last season, but is also the son o=
f
legendary UT pitcher and quarterback James Street.
""Our focus with this recruiting class was to add depth in the middle infiel=
d,
behind the plate and on the mound,"" Harmon said.  ""With the players that we
have signed for next year, we believe that we have accomplished that goal.""
UT also signed top catchers James Sweeney of Houston Bellaire,  one of the
best defensive catchers in the country, and Curtis Thigpen of Forney, who
batted .515 last season for Forney High School and is also regarded as an
outstanding defensive backstop and outfielder.
Other signees were Seth Johnston of Boerne, who hit .507 and was an
All-District shortstop;  for middle infielder Ryan Olivo of Grapevine, who
earned All-District honors after batting .450;   J.D. Reininger of Smithson
Valley, who earned All-District, All-City and All-State accolades while
pitching and playing both first and third base;  and right-hander Chas Tayl=
or
of Austin Westlake

Conradt Inks Super Class

Texas women's basketball coach Jody Conradt has signed the best player in=
=20
Texas, the best player in Oklahoma a member of Canada's Junior National Tea=
m,
and she also got the signature of a versatile guard-forward from Houston.
Joining the Longhorns next year will be 6-2 forward Kala Bowers of Woodward=
,
Oklahoma, a USA Today and Street & Smith All-American who is rated as the
16th best player in the nation by  the Rivals.com Top 100 recruiting servic=
e;
6-2 forward Heather Schreiber of Windthorst, an AAU All-American and
three-time First Team All-State performer rated as the No. 1 player in Texa=
s
by the Texas Girls Basketball Report and the Texas Hoops recruiting service=
;
6-2 forward Jody Bell of Chestermere High School in Alberta, Canada, a memb=
er
of the 2000 Canadian Junior National Team, and 5-11 All-State guard Colenci=
a
""Coco"" Reed of Houston Jersey Village, ranked as the 18th best player in
Texas by Texas Hoops.
Bowers was one of only four high school players invited to the 2000 USA
Basketball Junior National Team Trials.
She averaged 16 points, 7.4 rebounds, three assists and three blocks per ga=
me
as a junior last year as she led Woodward to the Oklahoma state championshi=
p
game. Woodward won the state crown her sophomore year, and has lost  just t=
wo
games over the last two seasons, going 53-2.
Bowers had scholarship offers from more than a dozen top schools. She
narrowed it down to Colorado and Texas before picking the Longhorns. Illino=
is
and Kansas State were other schools she strongly considered.
Schreiber was named an AAU All-American this past summer while leading her
Texas AAU 17-Under squad to a third-place finish at the AAU National
Championships while averaging 21 points 13 rebounds and five assists per ga=
me.
An outstanding three-sport All-State athlete in basketball, volleyball and
track & field, Schreiber averaged 24.4 points, 10 rebounds, 5.2 steals, 4
assists and 3.4 blocks per game for Texas' 1A power Windthorst as a junior.
As a junior, Schreiber  shot 62 percent from the floor and 45 percent from
three-point range. A star on the volleyball court, she has led Windthorst t=
o
three consecutive Texas state championships while being named State
Tournament MVP as a freshman, sophomore and junior.
On the track, Schreiber has cleared 5-10 in the high jump. She won the stat=
e
high jump crown as a sophomore and was runnerup in the high jump as a
freshman and junior and state runnerup in the long jump as a junior.
She had offered from many top schools, but committed to Texas very early in
the recruiting process.
Bell, a versatile 6-2 wing/post, was a starter on the 2000 Canadian Junior
National Team, which competed this past summer in the Tournament of the
Americas in Argentina, placing fifth.
Bell started four of the five games in the tournament. She has led
Chestermere High School to a No. 1 ranking in the province.
Named the province of 1998-99 Alberta 3A Rookie of the Year as a sophomore,
she led Chestermere to the 1999 AAA Provincial Championship.
Last season, Chestermere spent the year ranked No. 1 or No. 2 in the
province. In 83 games during her two-year high school career, Bell has
registered 1,303 points for a 15.7 ppg career scoring average, and is on pa=
ce
to set the school scoring record.
Entering her senior season, she holds career averages of 10.2 rebounds, 2.2
assists, 3.2 steals and 2.4 blocks per game.
She had offers from colleges all over Canada and the northern part of the
United States, but decided she wanted to head for warmer weather for her
college career and her other finalist was Arizona State.
Reed was All-State, All-District and All-Conference last season. She also i=
s
rated 112th nationally in the Reebok All-Star Report.
She helped lead Jersey Village into the 2000 Texas state playoffs, and her
playoff highlights included 21 points in a 63-39 win over Austin Bowie and =
22
points in a 66-57 quarterfinal loss to Austin's Westlake High School
""These four players will immediately raise the talent level of our program,
just as the class of 2000 signees has done,"" Conradt said.
""I am extremely pleased with our signings, and the talent level coming into
our program is the result of tremendous work done by our entire coaching
staff,"" she said.
""Each one of these players are considered among the very best players comin=
g
out of their respective states and, in Jody's case, in all of Canada,""
Conradt said.
""All four can play a variety of positions.  All four are mobile, athletic
players, all from winning programs, and they all  just love basketball,"" sh=
e
said.

Football Notes . .

Texas' offense rolled up 637 yards of total offense on Kansas Saturday. . .
Senior RB Hodges Mitchell set a school and Big 12 record for
all-purposeyardage. With 264 yards rushing, 23 yards receiving  and 88 yard=

performance. He is also the second UT running back ever to run for
back-to-back 200-yard games. . . Freshman WR Roy Williams had three

Barnes Signs Fine Pair

Heralded point guard T.J. Ford, 5-11, 165, of Sugar Land Willowridge, and
center Chris Wright, 6-10, 235, of Redwater, signed basketball letters of
intent with Texas last Wednesday, the first day of the fall signing period.
Coach Rick Barnes said Bob Gibbons' All-Star  Report  rates Ford as the
nation's top point guard recruit and picks Wright as the No. 25 center
prospect in the country.
Ford averaged 10 points, 9 assists, 5 rebounds and 4 steals per game as a
junior in leading Willowridge to the Class 5A state title.
Wright averaged 20.6 points, 13 rebounds and 7 blocks per game as a junior.
I saw Ford play both games at the State Tournament last season and he is as
quick as any player  I have seen. He can run faster dribbling the ball than
most players can run without the ball.
He also has amazing court vision and can drill lightning-quick passes.
While he is a good shooter and can dunk the ball with ease, he appears to b=
e
much more interested in setting a teammate up with an easy basket.
""With the signing of  T.J. and Chris, we feel like we are continuing to
elevate our program,"" Barnes said. ""We are extremely pleased, as both T.J.
and Chris are not only very talented on the basketball floor, but also
outstanding young men.""
Ford is the top high school prospect in the state, according to Mike
Kunstadt's Texas Hoops. He lead his team to a 36-1 overall record and the
Class 5A state title last season.
He is tabbed the 17th-best overall prospect  in the nation by Clark Francis=
'
Hoop Scoop, the 22nd-best prospect by ESPN.com and the 28th-best prospect b=
y
Dave Telep's Rivals100.com.
""T.J. is one of the most unselfish players I have seen in all my years of
recruiting,"" Barnes said.  ""He truly does not care if he scores a point. He
really loves distributing the basketball.""
""T.J. is excellent at understanding how to manage the game on both ends of
the court,"" Barnes said. "" Longhorn fans everywhere are going to fall in lo=
ve
with this kid.""
Wright is a versatile player who can play center or forward. He was a virtu=
al
unknown until Barnes and his assistants discovered him last year, invited h=
im
for an official visit, offered him a scholarship and got a commitment.
After he committed to Texas, other schools discovered him, too, and he
started showing up on recruiting lists because he is a big guy who can run,
handle the ball and is very athletic, too.
""Chris is a guy who we really stumbled upon early,"" Barnes said.  ""He is ve=
ry
athletic, he has a  tremendous work ethic and he has the ability to play
several positions on the floor.  I'm not sure anyone understands just how
good Chris can be.""
With these two signings, Texas has no remaining scholarships to award for t=
he
current season.


Two Volleyball Aces Ink with UT

Texas volleyball coach Jim Moore has signed Austin Westlake star Bethany
Howden and club All-American LaTonya Coates of Bangor, Mich.
""We worked tremendously hard in the recruiting process this year and the
result is the signing of these two fine young ladies,"" Moore said.
""In terms of talent on the court, this is the best class we've signed since
I've been here,"" Moore said. ""It continues our goal of signing volleyball
players with tremendous athleticism.""
Howden is a 6-2 middle blocker who recently completed her senior season. A
three-year starter, she led the Chaps to a 101-21 combined record and
back-to-back UIL District Championships.
She led Westlake in kills (303), hitting percentage (.470) and aces (27)
while ranking second in blocks (109) this season.
She was tabbed the District 14-5A Newcomer of the year as a sophomore, and
was First Team All-District and Second Team Austin American Statesman
All-Centex honors as a junior.
On the club scene, Howden is a member of Austin Juniors and recently teamed
with current Longhorn freshman Kathy Hahn to lead the 18 Navy squad to a
perfect 15-0 record in the 2000 Tour of Texas circuit. She helped 18 Navy c=
ap
the season by finishing tops among all Texas teams (14th) at the 2000 Junio=
r
Olympics.
She also has great Longhorn bloodlines. Her father, Lynn, was an outstandin=
g
basketball player at Texas from 1969 through 1972. He is 6-6 and her mother=
,
also a UT grad, is 5-11.
""Bethany Howden not only has great athleticism and superior leaping ability=
,
but also has the makeup to step in and start right away,"" Moore said.
Coates is a 5-10 outside hitter. She is coached by her mother, Dorothy
Coates, at Bangor Public High School. Coates, a three-year starter on the
varsity squad, enters her senior season with her eyes on a third straight
All-State certificate from the Detroit Free Press.
On the club level, Coates has earned two All-America honors in leading USA
Michigan to a pair of National Championships, including the 2000 Under-17
crown in Louisville, Ky., for which she was named Tournament MVP.
She also made the All-Tournament Team at the 1999 Under-16 Championships in
New Orleans.
Coates also is one of Michigan's top softball pitchers, needing only 129
strikeouts to break the state record of 1,508, and has earned a pair of
All-Conference honors in basketball, having led her varsity team in scoring
and assists during both her freshman and sophomore seasons.
""La Tonya is probably the best all-around player we've had since Demetria
Sance,"" Moore said. ""She is the complete package in that she has tremendous
leaping ability, solid natural offensive instincts and is a good ball-contr=
ol
player.""

She led San Pedro to the Los Angeles City Championship in 1998 and 2000 and
was an All-Area First Team selection in 1999 and 2000.

1999) and is a two-time South Hills Scholastic High Honor Roll member.
""With Osterman and the solid group of athletes we are surrounding her with,=
 I
feel we have one of the top classes nationally for next year,"" Clark said.
""We are pleased that we were able to recruit the offense we will need to
surround Osterman's phenomenal pitching, as we graduate five seniors at the
end of the upcoming 2001 season.""
""This class, combined with this year's newcomers, provide the stability,
talent and enthusiasm we need for the future,"" she said.

Horns Sign Top Golfer

Texas golf coach John Fields has signed three-time Future Collegians World
Tour All-American Charlie Santaularia of Free State HS in Lawrence, Kansas.
Santaularia is the No. 1 player in the state of Kansas and is ranked No. 31=

Brad,

(see message below from Melba)

Which one should we use, and how should it look on the website?  Remember, 
only five characters will fit in the name.  Maybe just CNGNo?
Let me know and i'll forward to Melba.

Vince,

Thank you for your efforts in talking to your corporate recruiting
people.  Maybe we could figure something out next time.  For your trip on
Nov. 1, please let me know if you'd like us to book a hotel for you or
you'd like to make your own arrangement.  The tentative plan is that we
can go to dinner together on 10/31.  On 11/1, I am thinking about
having you meet with another faculty, I and a Ph.D student from 10am to
11am.  We are supervising the Ph.D. student on finding research topics in
bandwidth trading.  The seminar will be from 11am to noon.  Our QCF
director will take you to lunch after the seminar.  And at 2pm, we'd
like you to meet with our QCF students for an hour or so.  Let me know if
this sounds fine to you.

Please send me the title and abstract of your talk as soon as possible so
that I could make the announcement soon.  Thanks.

Shijie

I was able to change the first deal in Sitara, but the other pricing request 
I did not feel comfortable making any changes.  Would you please look at this 
pricing issue for Client Services since they need to get it paid on Monday.

Please correct the following deals:

Enron Canada purchase deal # 121397  Was 4.18427 should be 4.10185  This is 
due to a Buy/back at Chippawa which reduces our Sithe transport by 
$70,191.70   I normally book this manually (with Journal entry) but with SAP, 
it needs to be in Unify and this is the only deal I can book it to.  The 
Sithe transport is in Canadian dollars and this reduction is in US $.


Also I have the following deals which are scheduled different on our side 
that Enron Canada and causes me about a $500 out of balance each month.  We 
have netted this with other out of balances in previous months but with SAP, 
I can no longer do this. Here is what happens:

ENA Books:  Purchase Deal 290657  for 30,390  MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.005 = $4,125,442.50
            Sale Deal 290652 for     ( 5,000) MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.0075=    678,375.00
                                                                              
  Total          $3,447,067.50
                                                                        
Enron Canada Books:

            Sale                  for 20,000 MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.005=   $2,715,000.00
  Sale                  for  5,390 MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.     =      732,501.00
                                                                              
  Total          $3,447,501.00

I don't know why we book a purchase and sale but it messes up the deal in 
SAP.  Can we change the ENA sale deal 290652 to posting -.005 and the ENA 
purchase deal # 290657 tier it for 25,000 at Posting -.005 and balance at 
posting.  Let me know as soon as possible.  I need to pay this AM on Monday.


Thanks, Jane

Subject: Christmas List

Hello Vince and Mike

I want to keep you informed.

This year all baskets will be done in a timely manner.
On last year we were going through a major move therefore 
many people played key roles in keeping us together.
This year however , is a little different , as it is always nice
to give unfortunately we can not give to everyone.
I am sending a lists of who we have so far.


There are a few names on the list that  I feel we should do something else 
for this year .
under Shirley's list of names.

(not so expensive)

They are : Move Team                                who?
                     Mail Room                                    who?   
                     Facilities Help Desk                  who?

There are other tokens of appreciation that we can get for them.

Please note that you two are the only ones that have seen this e-mail so far
I will need your approval for all baskets, however your input on the matter 
will be 
greatly appreciated.The list is not completed I am still waiting for 
additions.


                    
                                              Thanks

Sir,

I just got word that your bottom line needs to be 2,200K.  This is net of 
Corp Charges and Intercompany billings.  In order to get to this number, we 
have to reduce your budget by 83K.  Do you have any suggestions in which 
category(ies) we need to reduce?

 Budget  10,521,000
 I/C billings   8,238,000
 Subtotal   2,283,000
 Per Delainey   2,200,000
 Need to dec by      83,000

Here are my suggestions based on Oct expenses:

 Category   Oct expense  Budget  Decrease Yearly amount

 Periodical/subscription  5,200   10,000  3,000  36,000
 Tuition and Reimbursement 11,000   21,000  4,000  48,000

This will bring you to the bottom line suggested by Delainey.  Please let me 
know your decision by November 21.  If you have any questions, call me at 
5-7094.  Thanx.

That explains the Sep trade.  No, the confirm they returned does not work 
because it does not reference the guarantor.  Thanks.

Tanya,

The May confirmation (NH9975.1) was signed and returned to me on October 19.  
On this confirmation, the counterparty change the name from (PII) to (PIC).  
Can we now say that this confirmation is valid?  

There was a swaption (NZ0399.1) with a trade date of 9/8/00 and an expiration 
date of 9/13/00 -- that may explain the 9/13 template.  However, that 
swaption was not exercised.

Thanks,

Tiffany

Subject: Paperboard Industries International

I spoke with Louise Paul and she confirmed that they would like to use 
Paperboard Industries Corporation (PIC) as the contracting entity and would 
be willing to provide a corporate guaranty from Paperboard Industries 
International (PII).

I am confused as to how many trades actually exist.  Per TAGG, there are two 
(NH9975.1 done on May 12 and Q25809.1 done on October 4); however, in the 
legal database Susan references a September 13 template sent out which Louise 
Paul also mentioned.  Is this a real deal or was it just a draft?

As the May confirm was never signed, I do not know if we will need to 
actually assign it to the new entity.  We need to make sure that all of the 
confirms reference PIC as the contracting entity with PII as guarantor.  All 
of the credit terms apply; however they will apply to the guarantor now 
instead of the counterparty.   I have also changed the MAC trigger to B+ as 
PII has been downgraded from BB- to B+.  I have attached a new credit 
worksheet for your reference. If there are any other inconsistencies to the 
previous documents other than what I have referenced, please let me know. 

Also, the database mentions the Enron Corp gty that was delivered in 
conjunction with the May trade.  Can you confirm the amount at $15MM as well 
as send me a copy for my file?

Louise has asked that all correspondence be directed to her attention. Please 
let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Tanya

RNC Shakeup: Swapping a General for a Colonel
By Mike Bayham

This past weekend the ""leadership"" of the national Republican Party
converged on Austin, Texas to ratify the second RNC head in as many
years.  The vote to elect former Montana Governor Marc Racicot was a
mere formality with President George W. Bush's post-election/debacle
decree that Racicot should be running the RNC going into the mid-term
Congressional races.

It is tradition, and good policy, that the occupant of the White House,
or his advisers, select the chairman of the national party so that the
strategies and messages coming out of both camps are coordinated.
 Because the now immediate past RNC Chairman did not fully understand
this tradition and reality, he is now out of a job.

115,000 people from Middle Eastern countries live in the United States
illegally. The estimates are based on the Bureau's preliminary analysis
of the 2000 census. The findings are especially troubling given the role
failures in immigration control played in September 's terrorist
attacks. Not only were at least three of the September 11th hijackers
illegal aliens, a number of past terrorists have also been illegal
aliens from the Middle East, including Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer, who tried
to bomb the New York subway system in 1997, and Mohammed Salameh, who
took part in the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993.

Non-Partisan CBO Confirms Recession and War Caused Surplus Decline --
Not Tax Relief
GOPUSA News Wire

CBO confirms recession and war caused surplus decline: CBO Director Dan
Crippen said &quot;over 70% of (FY2002 surplus reduction) results from
the weak economy and related technical factors&quot; (source: CBO
testimony 1/23/02).  CBO said bipartisan tax relief resulted in less
than 12% of the surplus decline in FY 2002.

Fighting Terror in the Philippines will be Different
By Austin Bay

Defeating Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan has given the United
States tremendous political momentum, which bodes well for upcoming
military and diplomatic operations in The War on Terror.

However, an American public now familiar with ""the Afghan example"" of
warfare should not expect that model to apply too rigorously in the
Philippines.

Don't Believe Everything You Read
By Linda Chavez

The coincidence was almost too good to be true. ""An old news video of
Lt. Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings during the
Reagan Administration,"" the e-mail from a friend began, ""what he said
was stunning!"" I remember the event well.

I worked with Ollie North in the Reagan White House from 1985 until
early in 1986, when I was director of public liaison. He was a
charismatic speaker, one I frequently enlisted for briefings on the
situation in Nicaragua, where the United States was trying to help a
group of guerrillas known as the Contras, who were trying to overthrow
the communist Sandinista government there. When Congress cut off funds
to the Contras, Ollie helped set up a clandestine operation to raise
private money for the group. In November 1986, the operation was
discovered, leading to the worst crisis of the Reagan administration and
to criminal indictments against North (whose conviction was later
overturned) and others involved. The Congress also held hearings in
which North and others testified.

The GOP Abandons Its Pro-Life Platform
By Bonnie Chernin Rogoff

It is the 29th anniversary of Roe v. Wade.  Usually an anniversary
symbolizes a happy occasion, such as a wedding or a graduation or the
birth of a son or a daughter.

It is only since 1973, on that ominous day 29 years ago, that America
celebrates the deaths of her sons and daughters.  Nearly 50 million sons
and daughters to be precise.

*** Re: Dear Mr. President, There are Still Right-Wing Republicans Out
Here (Dorothy Anne Seese)

This is the best article, and I feel much more comfortable to know that
people like Dorothy exist. I think we Republicans should support this
kind of attitudes and urge the president to take it into consideration.
I am proud of her and whish her the best. God Bless America and bless
people like Dorothy. Thank you
-- Lucia Nazarian

Thank you, Dorothy Anne, for writing so clearly what so many of us are
thinking.
-- Darlene Hagen, Plano, TX

I so much appreciate the article by Dorothy Seese. I have been very
frustated with our party on many issues including the ones in the
article. The writer could have also pointed out the sins of the party
regarding recent legislation such as the ""Patriot Act"" or ""Antiterrorism
Bill"". This legislation destroyed the Fourth Amendment and has many
other flaws. Thank you Dorothy for speaking out.
-- Stan Jaggars, Agency, MO

*** Re: Congress Fails Military Retirees... Again (Heather Wayman)

You have done something most of the press absolutely refuses to do...
you  have allowed Heather Wayman to publish her factual  articles in an
up & coming internet periodical which simply shows the betrayal most
veterans are facing from the government they swore to defend.  Again,
thank you for the fairness you have shown.
-- Roy Alba, USAF, Retired

Great, well written article.  I know President Bush will do the right
thing. We need to do all we can for our Veterans.  I'd rather pay them
than non-deserving welfare recipients.
Barbara Edgerton, Houston, TX

HIP HIP HOORAY! To Heather Wayman! You said it and wrote it correctly.
I'm still baffled by Congress. I wish they would've gotten out there and
spent at least 20 years of military service. But they didn't! Why?
'Cause it's tough duty! I just don't understand them, but I do
understand their pay raises which should be going to disabled veterans!
-- Alma R. Farrar, SFC(Ret.) U.S. Army

Sir, I would like to take the opportunity to thank Heather Wayman and
GOPUSA for the article outlining the injustices pertaining to military
retirees and concurrent receipt of VA disability compensation.  SHe did
a wonderful job, and clearly outlined the injustice to all disabled
military retirees. I am a retiree of the U.S. Navy (20 years), and a
disabled Vietnam Veteran. I have been paying for my own VA compensation
for almost 30 years!! I should have been a Congressman!! Thanks again,
Heather!
-- Frank Ray, Middletown, RI

*** Re: 'Black Hawk Down' Brilliantly Depicts The Peril of Entrusting
Our Military to Liberal Statesmen (Rick Erickson)

The events of Mogadishu, as depicted in Black Hawk Down, brings
compelling clarity to the reality that when our sons, our daughters and
our fathers who serve in the US military are commanded to put their
lives on the line; that they are allowed to quickly and decisively
effect defeat of their opponent without the restrictions imposed by
political considerations. The US military forces are an awesome power
that should only be unleashed when we mean business, never as bluffing
tool. Hoo-ah!
-- Steve Findley, TX

Thanks to Rick Erickson for telling the truth. As a former US Navy
member serving during that time and wanting to be there, most of my
shipmates were outraged at what Clinton and Aspen did. I would hope that
this information would hit the mainstream press, but I am not holding my
breath. I wonder what the public would say if they knew the real facts
about what really happened. I will go and see this movie and know that I
will shed a tear for my brothers. Thanks again Mr. Erickson, shipmate.

Dear ST_SW Traders,

FYI - 
There was a cut on deal # 622350.1 on June 2, 2001 for HE 11.  It was a real time cut that reduced the schedule from 40 MW to 25 MW.  Mirant is at fault for the cut. (our up-stream is PAC).  
We originally thought that this got booked out between Mirant and WAPA, but when I spoke with Kathy yesterday, she informed me that there was no bookout and that they want to cut the schedule.  (the people involved during the cut were Geir at EPMI, Bob at PAC, Emily at Mirant, and Jackie for WAPA (Jackie is a control area dispatcher, so she cannot do bookouts for WAPA, hence there was no bookout)).  

We have agreed that to cut the schedule will be the best for now.  They do not plan on charging us LD's (she's checking with her boss to make sure.)  We will just reduce the schedules to 25 for HE 11.

It is up to you if you want to charge LD's to Mirant for the spread.

Just wanted to let you know and get your input.

Virginia"

Over the last several years, we've received numerous questions and candid 
comments from many of you on a wide range of topics during our eSpeak 
sessions and through the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and 
voicemail.  While eSpeak is an open, informal chat between employees and 
management, the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and voicemail box are 
designed as confidential upward feedback tools for employees who choose 
anonymity.  We are pleased that many of you have openly expressed your 
thoughts and your identity, which made it possible for us to quickly respond 
to your questions and concerns.  This is the kind of work environment we all 
must strive for at Enron, and we encourage you to continue sending us 
comments about the things that are important to you.

Many times, however, we wanted to respond to those of you who contacted us 
anonymously with your good ideas, observations and questions.  We now have a 
way to do this while maintaining your confidentiality.  In the future, when 
we receive an anonymous question or comment from an employee, both the 
question and our response will be posted on eMeet.  This will allow us to 
answer all the questions that we receive, and it will give other employees an 
opportunity to provide their insight, if they choose to do so, since eMeet is 
an open discussion board.

Remember:  You can send your questions and comments to us in two ways:
 - email to Office of the Chairman, or
 - Office of the Chairman voicemail box at 713-853-7294, which is a 
confidential call

Promoting open and honest communication is consistent with our Vision and 
Values and absolutely vital to our continued success as a company.  So don't 
be hesitant or afraid to speak your mind.  We want to hear from you."

Scott,

Finally, here's the resolution on the Coenergy invoice for April, 1999.

Coenergy is telling me that the we need to pay the difference $2.90 vs. $2.74 
on 10,000 MMBtu per day.  If this is true, please pay the difference of 
$0.155 to Coenergy on a volume of 10,000 MMBtu per day for April, 1999.

If your understanding is different, please let me know, but otherwise please 
pay the difference.

Thank you for your patience, and sorry it took so long to resolve.

The existing position with these guys is that we have been buying gas month to month.  1,500/d from England Energy, and 15,000/d from Dominion E&P.  I'll keep you posted on additional conversations.

As you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time.  Dominion E & P and England Energy will no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the Dynergy/Enron merger.  They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.  

I feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.  They said it then like they say it now, ""it's not you Paul, we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new.""

  Upon receipt of a notice to exercise ROFR, you must determine the criteria of when the notice is required,  In the example provided I'm told it required a one year notice therefore if the contract terminated 10/31/02, notice was due 10/31/01.  Therefore 10 days after 10/31/01 the capacity must be posted for bidding.  In the interim, since it has not yet been posted a transaction could be negotiated and the shipper would then be required to provide notice of resinding the original election to participate in the Rofr process.  If this isn't clear, please call    MK"

Enron Names Jeff McMahon Chief Financial Officer

HOUSTON, Oct 24, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) announced today that it has named Jeff McMahon chief financial officer. McMahon had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group. From 1998 to 2000, McMahon was Enron's treasurer. 
""Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron,"" said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and CEO. ""He has the trust and confidence of our investors and financial institutions."" 
Andrew Fastow, previously Enron's CFO, will be on a leave of absence from the company. ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" Lay said. 
McMahon, 40, joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations. Upon returning to the United States, McMahon was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp. In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works, where he had responsibility for Enron's e-commerce activities. 
McMahon has a bachelor's degree in business from the University of Richmond in Virginia. He is a Certified Public Accountant, SFA registered and is a member of the American Institute of Public Accountants and Association of Corporate Treasurers. 
Enron is one of the world's leading energy, commodities and services companies. The company markets electricity and natural gas, delivers energy and other physical commodities, and provides financial and risk management services to customers around the world. Enron's Internet address is www.enron.com . The stock is traded under the ticker symbol ""ENE"".

Jay/Allan,

FYI and evaluation, attached is a business plan from the CALME group.  Please 
let me know what you think.  They are trying to play ball and sent this to 
us.  Also they are beginning to call me.  

I had planned to send this to you while I was out but it wouldn't go thru 
properly from San Francisco.  Allan, please give her a call and let her know 
you received it and let her know your overall impression.

By the way, Karen is David Haug's new fiancee.

Thanks,
Mike

As per David's request and our discussion on Friday evening, please take a 
look at the business plan submitted for the trading exchange. Let me know if 
you would like to pursue it so that I can facilitate an introduction if it is 
necessary. Alternatively, I can have the company call you directly.

Shawn,

This came through to me through some contacts in the DR. I am not sure if you 
would be interested in seeing if the model applies in any other countries in 
your region. Additionally, who is the person who would be a counterpart for 
the Southern Cone. Let me know if it tickles you as I need to get back to 
them over the next week.

Interruptible Rate Structure/Black-Outs
Today, Eden Prairie High School, a suburb of Minneapolis, Minnesota had
their electric service cut off by the local utility as part of their
interruptible rate structure.  An event like this -- students attempting to
learn in a dark, uncomfortably hot environment (outdoor temp 92 degrees) --
calls to mind an important natural gas-related issue: The availability and
attractiveness of gas-fired technologies (gas-fired air conditioning and
gas-fired power generation, for instance) to participate in the U.S. energy
picture.  This, in turn, raises the larger issue of a national energy polic=
y
and the role of natural gas to meet our various energy needs.

Big Questions for The Big Thinkers.  For those of us a little closer to ""th=
e
trenches""....

This sequence of e-mails is a little confusing, so I highlighted the parts 
you probably want to focus on in red. Like I said, I've been staring at these 
deals for too many hours now to see clearly what went wrong. As far as I can 
tell, either APB or Jeff Richter was checking out wrong. Now I just want to 
get to the bottom of it! Aaaaaaaa!

Subject: Re: apb checkout  

I just want to clarify something, because we were here until about 9 p.m. 
last night trying to flatten our position, and just figured out this morning 
that we were off due to the Williams deal that I changed yesterday evening. 
Apparently Jeff Richter didn't do any deals with Williams for 50 MW through 
APB, but he did do one for 50 MW with Prebon. So I'm wondering why APB was 
checking out like this? If possible, I'd like to avoid this in the future. 
Let me know if you can find anything out from APB.

Thanks,
Kate

when we are done, I will forward it along to the group.  So as not to hold 
you up, I am attaching a comprehensive list of proposed legislation in both 
the Assembly and the Senate in California, along with short summary of what

In the past few weeks, I have discussed this issue with Brent H., Mark T. 
Chris G. and Mary C.  Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes 
Alberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not 
clearly categorized as ""money"" but more likely an ""account"".  Although 
certain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including 
""money"", ""intangibles"", which includes ""accounts"", cannot be perfected by 
possession.  The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a 
wire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes ""money"".  Although 
it is not clear, the better view is that ""money"" means cash in hand and not 
on deposit.  The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinate 
to various parties, including a bankruptcy trustee and to subsequently taken 
but properly perfected security interests.  I will admit, however, that this 
seems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likely 
unknowingly).     

Accordingly, to perfect the ""account"" a registration is likely required at 
the PPR, which is something we do not want to get into. 

Even then, as an ""account"" is an ""intangible"" certain conflicts rules for 
perfection by registration need to be considered, as the PPSA jurisdictions 
provide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of the 
jurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location of 
its principal place of business or chief executive office. i.e.  registration 
may be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.  Further, an advance 
search would have to be done to see if there are competing prior 
registrations.  Also, as the PPR is not a guaranteed title registry, 
registration priority does not necessarily guarantee security priority, and 
law firms will not typically give priority opinions under the PPSA.  

Lastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is also 
a creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the deposit 
holding institution will assert rights of set off over the account.

In terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to my 
knowledge changed.  I suppose there is some possibility that a court has 
recently determined that ""money"" includes deposits that we are not aware of, 
and I could ask outside counsel to research this issue.

Peter.

Subject: Cash Collateral In Canada

Peter and Greg:
One of our counterparties is questioning why we won't accept cash collateral 
in Canada.  They claim that under the current state of the law, holding cash 
collateral is the method for perfecting.  Please advise.  Should we ask 
Stikeman to update their advice to us on this?

Thanks. I just checked Peoplefinder and all the new information is in there. 
One thing I couldn't change, however, was my department and supervisor. This 
may have to be changed by HR or my new supervisor; but at any rate, I now 
work in West Power Trading and report to Jeff Richter and Tim Belden.

Thanks for your help.

Lousie,
My group gathers the gas and power physical volumes that are used in quarte=
rly press releases, SEC filings and other communications.  Investor relatio=
ns typically likes to look at this information on a monthly basis to make s=
ure that they understand the direction that volumes are going.  The attache=
d file details gas and power volumes by region for the most recent periods.=
  The gas volumes from July to August of this year show a slight downward t=
rend that I wanted to make sure that you were aware of.  We pull this infor=
mation from the Unify settlement system and have rarely had problems with t=
he accuracy of that data.  None the less, we typically run it by desk heads=
 when the numbers don't seem to fit our expectations.  After a brief review=
 by the Central and East guys they told us that lower price volatility and =
the ICE trading platform were the significant reasons for the decline.  Is =
this in line with your expectations?  Power volumes on the other hand are u=
p considerably in August.  We have not received a response on that yet.

Please call me if you would like to discuss.

FYI

This message came in from the accounting group re: a combined option/water 
contract for the Longview project.

Apparently having separate documents for the option and the underlying 
contract is important from an accounting standpoint, even though there may be 
no difference in effect when compared with an option incorporated into the 
primary agreement.

Subject: FW: FW: Option for Wastewater Discharge and Water Reuse

Pursuant to discussions with AALLP, and as we discussed yesterday, combining 
the water agreement with the option agreement is contrary to the approach we 
agree upon with AALLP in configuring a true option agreement for water 
supply.  I explained our basic commercial reasons why we needed to do this to 
no avail.  The good news is that this, and only this agreement, may go out in 
your desired format but there will be no exceptions permitted going forward.  
Costs incurred around future documents that do not read as true option 
agreements prepared in accordance with parameters estab. with AALLP and 
accounting will be considered hard costs.  Hope this helps out.

Hi Herman,

Thank you for your quick review of the Option Agreement with CSOB. I will 
call you to discuss your comments further. However, there are some commercial 
reasons for combining the Wastewater Discharge and Effluent (Water reuse for 
cooling) into one option agreement. These reasons include the following:

1) Timing - We need to secure the wastewater discharge ability sooner than we 
can pull together all of the details for a firm agreement. By highlighting 
the major issues in the Option Agreeement we can confirm our discharge route 
while we pull together the details for the underlying agreement. At this 
point the Wastewater Discharge agreement that you referred to is on hold 
until we have additional technical and permitting information. It is also 
critical to ensure our ability to obtain effluent for cooling, prior to 
firming up all of the details for a separate, underlying agreement on 
effluent. 

2) Combination is faster - Given the timing concerns expressed above, it is 
faster to get there with one agreement rather than trying to work with the 
CSOB on two agreements. The proposals that we are suggesting to the CSOB are 
very new and somewhat out of their comfort zone. It is easier to get them 
comfortable with these concepts in one agreement and at one time rather than 
in two separate agreements. 

As I mentioned, I will call you to discuss further, but hopefully the above 
helps shed some light on our reasons for pulling together the agreement in 
this format. 

Regards,
Laura

I think this Option Agreement and Wastewater Discharge Agreement should be 
two separate agreements.  What I mean by this is that the items in 1 
a(i)-(ix) and 1 b(i)-(ii) should be carved out of this agreement and placed 
in the Wasterwater Discharge Agreement.  Remainder looks ok.

Subject: Option for Wastewater Discharge and Water Reuse
Importance: High

Hello,

Please see the attached Option Agreement. The intent of the Option is to firm 
up details for LED to discharge plant wastewater to the Cowlitz County sewer 
treatment plant's (referred to as Cowlitz Water Pollution Control ""CWPC"" 
plant) existing outfall on the Columbia River as well as obtain wastewater 
from CWPC for use in cooling. 

To give a little background, given our proximity to CWPC, the ability to 
discharge to CWPC's Columbia River outfall is a viable plan. It reduces the 
permitting time that would be required if we built our on outfall to the 
Columbia. It is cheaper than sending all of the plant wastewater through the 
whole treatment facility, especially given that cooling tower blowdown 
(primary source of plant wastewater) is very clean. 

We are also requesting effluent as a source of water for plant cooling given 
that the Port's ability to obtain new water rights is unclear at this point. 
Obtaining CWPC effluent is a viable option for plant cooling. 

Please contact me or Bob Carter if you have questions about this document. I 
expect to meet with the County next week to discuss. I would appreciate your 
comments mid-next week. On a priority scale, comments on this prior to the 
Water Agreement (sent in my previous e-mail) would be appreciated. 

Thank you in advance for your assistance. 

Regards,
Laura

Subject:	Southeast RTO draft affidavit


Hi Christi,

Here's the draft of the affidavit, which I have sent to Andrea Settanni as
well, to review.  The analysis has two sections 1) historical trading data
in the southeast, and 2)a power flow analysis of 61 different transactions
to examine parallel flows.  We found that for all types of transactions
there are extensive parallel flows throughout the southeast (Grid South,
Southern Company, Grid Florida, and Entergy), including TVA and SPP as well.
SPP seems to be as tightly tied to MAPP as to Entergy and SoCo, so could go
either way (i.e. with the Southeast or with the Midwest).

In addition to significant parallel flows throughout, my analysis of the
trade data showed quite a bit of marketer activity (both marketers such as
Enron and Coral... and also marketing affiliates of transmission providers).
To me this says that a large RTO is required because marketers are clearly
important participants in the electricity markets in the southeast, and they
do not confine themselves to small areas. The regions will need consistent
trading and market rules if strong competitive markets are to develop and
continue to allow the expansion of trade.

This draft should become a final version once Andrea has had a chance to
check the content and format.  Please let me know if this affidavit
addresses your questions, or if you want to have any additional questions
analyzed.

Thank you,
Judy

Elizabeth - 

Regulatory Risk Analytics (Cost Center 103246) is to be rolled up to Rick 
Shapiro.  If possible the cost center will be collapsed and the budget rolled 
to Cost Center 100108 and 103885.  It is my understanding that Amr Ibrahim 
will be moving into Harry's group and Regulatory Risk & Analytics will be 
disbanded.

I have printed the SAP report for 103246 and make note that employee costs 
(salary, benefits, taxes) were budgeted but no actuals have hit the cost 
center thus far.  Can you advise if these costs are being rolled to Steve 
Kean.  Can you also advise if these costs cover salary and benefits for Jim 
Steffes and Amr Ibrahim.

I can coordinate with Amanda Schultz on the accounting side of things but 
wanted to check with you on the salary and advise you generally of this 
change.

Please advise of any questions, comments or concerns.

I wanted to clarify our game plan for the next couple of weeks.

1.  Tomorrow a meeting is taking place with FuelCells to resolve some major 
outstanding business issues.  At this meeting, the point is going to be made 
that in order to maintain the desired schedule, FCE is going to have to 
increase its technical effort.  Presently, we are concerned that the 
technical aspects of the purchase order are not in sufficient order to 
finalize a purchase order by next week (we want to make certain that our deal 
with FuelCells is largely defined before we make a state filing).  We are 
going to emphasize to FCE that both sides need to devote their technical 
resources to this goal.  One of our priorities is to bring the technical 
portions of the purchase order up to the level necessary to finalize an 
order.  I need the Tony Leo list today so I can show FuelCells all the 
information that they owe us before this meeting.

2.  We have redrafted the purchase order.  However, the P.O. needs refinement 
to reflect the resolution of the outstanding business terms and to make 
certain that the technical information and procedures are clearly defined 
(much of the information that I sent you).  Given 1) the proposed payment 
mechanics and 2) FCE's lack of mature documents, we are concerned that FCE 
will try to get by with loose technical language to avoid acceptance and 
ultimately payment issues.  Also, we are concerned that once we make our 
state filing that our negotiating leverage with FCE will go down. One of our 
major focuses jobs between now and 11/3/00 is to make certain that the 
technical sections of the P.O. are properly defined.

3.  With regard to the BOP cost estimates, I would like to get the revised 
estimates no later than tomorrow.  Our current plan is to make a state filing 
(CRRA will make the filing and the filing will be the source of the funding)  
which clearly defines our basic assumptions in coming up with these estimates 
(we will not show the complete estimates) and to show conservative ranges.  
You will be given the opportunity to review and comment on the cost and 
technical information provided in the filing.  A draft of the filing is to be 
sent to CRRA by 11/3.  Given this approach, it is less important that we go 
to the sites next week.  Our focus should be on getting the purchase order 
into shape (from a technical point of view) and making sure that the state 
filing is accurate as to our base technical assumptions.

4.  The state filing is expected to be made by CRRA in the subsequent week.

Please give me a call if you have any questions."

I don't think I need new tires, unless I'm surprised.  You might want to buy 
an extra tire in case you get a flat.  I think I loaned Harry my old spare 
tire.  Anytime Saturday is fine...

I have a tire pump, but I could take it to Bikesport and have new ones put
on it and have it checked out.

What do you think?  Could I check it out on Saturday?

I did not find anybody in EBS who seems to know or be involved in any 
e-procurement issues.  In Enron Corp, however, there is an initiative called 
iBuyIt.  This is a system that Corp is deploying for e-procurement through 
Corp and ENA, and will get to EBS sometime late this year.

John Gillespie is in charge of the iBuyIt initiative.  Perhaps he is the 
appropriate contact.  I left a voice mail with him, but have not yet received 
a response.

Dr. Kaminski,

Sorry for the late response,
it took me some time to coordinate things.
Finally, it's almost dont :-)
It turned out that from June to August
will be best for me for work at ENRON
(Say June.4 to August.4)

But I still need to know several things from your side.
Could you answer following questions?

First:
Is my suggested working period is OK with you?
If so, let me know what to do for settlement
during the period.

Second:
I got a list of work, I might be able to do for
DealBench team from Ross and Suresh.
I'd like to know it is still a valid work list:
The list he sent is as following:

> 1.  Write a paper in layman's terms that answers
> questions like the following:
> Benefits of auctioning online for both buyers and
> sellers, particularly in reverse auctions
> Explanation how multi-variable auctions are not
> as efficient as price-only auctions (is this true?)
> How many participants are recommended for a
> successful live auction
> What types of goods and services are best suited
> for live auctions versus sealed bid quotes
> Opinions on lotting strategies
> Trends in online private auctions

> 2.  Identify appropriate recent auction research (3
> or 4 papers out of the 90+ you provided)and obtain approvals from the
> authors to post on our site

> 3. Create a list/bibiliography of relevant auction
> literature (with hyperlinks?)

> 4.  Would you be willing to offer auction consulting
> services to our customers (if they are interested)

Third:
There is an e-procurement forum at Haas School of business,
in May 22. The chair of the forum is my advisor Prof. Arie Segev.
A person from Wells Fargo Bank will talk about Wells Fargo's role
in e-marketplace payment initiative,
where ENRON broadband services is also one of key players
along with Citibank.
He asked me whether you can contact a person at
ENRON broadband services, who's related to the initiative.
He wants to know whether we will have a speaker from ENRON
to see ENRON's perspective, in the Forum.

Here is a link to news related to the initiative,

http://www.internetweek.com/story/INW20000808S0001

Fourth:
My advisor wants to know whether
there could be any opportunity to do a case study,
regarding ENRON's business.
He is interested in e-procurement and e-marketplaces.
Business model and System architecture...

Thanks for reading this long email.
I'll look forward to your answer..
I am sorry for giving you so much burden
to answer those questions possibly not easy to answer.

Warm regards,
Jinbaek

IN THE NEWS...""Kids Find Contested Ballot to be Child's Play,""
The Shreveport Times, by Don Walker

""It's a ballot that perplexed Florida voters but was no match for the wits
of first- and fourth-graders at Stockwell Elementary School in Bossier City.


""Disillusioned and upset by the lingering chaos of this week's presidential
election, fourth-grade teacher Lisa Burns pulled a sample of the
controversial Palm Beach County, Fla., ballot off the Internet on Thursday.
She then put her class of 9- and 10-year-olds to the test.  'I gave them a
ballot and had them take a blue marker to vote for Al Gore and a red marker
to vote for George Bush. Then I had them put their name on the bottom of the
ballot and turn it in.'

""Turns out this election was mere child's play. Not one of the 22 students
present in class Thursday was confused by the ballot. Each one was marked
without error.

""Well, if a fourth-grader could do it, how about a first-grader? Down the
hall in Stacey Robinson's class, the ballot was handed out to 6- and
7-year-olds. Robinson used an overhead projector to point out Gore's name,
then asked the class of 24 students to find his bubble on the punch-card
ballot.

""'It wasn't a vote,' Robinson said. 'I just wanted to experiment to see if
they could find the correct bubble.'

""When the ballots were turned in, 19 of the first-graders marked the correct
bubble for Gore, three picked Buchanan's bubble, one picked Bush's and one
marked the bottom bubble for the 'Natural Law' party.

""'If a first-grader can choose the correct bubble, there's no legitimate
claim. Anyone could have done it,' Robinson said. 'A grown adult who took
any time at all could find it.'

""Still, even in a first-grade classroom, vote tabulations were the subject
of protest and controversy. 'I thought we were voting,' Brady McCoy, 6, of
Haughton grumbled after he was told to find and punch the 'Gore' bubble. 'I
wanted to vote for George Bush!'""

As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to ""business as usual.""   As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel.  
 The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.  We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules.
We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.   
Employees planning international travel can find updated security information on their country of destination on http://home.enron.com under the ""International Travel"" section of the Corporate Security website.  
All U.S.-based employees should continue to make their travel arrangements through Travel Agency in the Park at (713) 650-8080 or (800) 962-0248. Other employees should contact their local travel agency for assistance."

Duque's Decision passed 3-2 (Duque, Neeper, Bilas - Lynch, Wood) - Both 
Neeper and Bilas said that they were only voting for this decision because of 
pressure. They both felt that last meeting's decision provided sufficient 
relief and provided for a investigation to address longer term problems.

Summary: 

The Decision institutes a rate stabilization for residential and commercial 
customers
 Residential: $68 through 1/1/01 and $75 through 12/31/01 for those who 
consume 500kW or less - market prices for the others residential 
 Commercial: $220 through 1/1/01 and $240 through 12/31/01 for those who 
consume 1500 kW or less - market place for other commercial

Other rate schedules: Subject to market prices

Implementation date: Retroactive to 6/1/00 - SDG&E will provide a credit for 
those customers that are eligible no latter than September 30th

The decision intends to allow for future adjustment of the kWh rate caps 
retroactive to June 1, 200 to ensure that customers in hotter inland regions 
have an appropriate level of usage cap and medium size commercial customers 
are provided relief.

The bill stabilization plan requires SDG&E to file comments, by September 30, 
addressing the implementation and transition of a Levelized Payment Plan 
(LPP) for all customers on an ""opt out"" basis. However, the procedure for the 
implementation of the LLP will allow customers to readily exercise choice, 
while those that do not exercise choice will default into the LPP.

The Commission will also further study the bill stabilization plan as to 
direct access customers. 

Revenue shortfalls are to be booked into the TCBA for future recovery of the 
net shortfall. 

Discussion: 
Senator Alpert, Assembly Women Davis, Mayor Golding , the former mayor, 
several members of the City and County of San Diego Board of Supervisors made 
a public appearance. All thanked the Commission for  having this special 
session. All supported the Wood decision. All stated that it did not  go far 
enough and insisted that all customers should be subject to the cap. Assembly 
Women Davis stated that she would be going back to the legislation  to pass 
the Davis/Alpert Bill establishing a cap for all customers. However, 
Asseblymember Wright, chairman of the Utilities and Commerce Committee, has 
been open and has shown opposition to the Alpert/Davis bill.

Nedre:
Per your request, here is what we have decided:

1. Our 2 best candidates were Jackie McCoy and Samantha Boyd.  As I mentioned 
to you, Mark will be talking to HR about making an offer to Samantha Boyd but 
until she formally accepts, we don't want to lose Jackie or say anything to 
her.

2. We have passed on the following candidates:

Stephanie Panus
Patricia Slaughter
Donald Duhon
Debra Vincent


Of this group, we may pass on to other groups that have expressed interest  
to Mark Taylor in hiring for a non-legal position, the resumes of Stephanie 
Panus and Debra Vincent and certainly Jackie McKoy if Samantha accepts.  It 
would be helpful to know from you when these particular  passed over 
candidates have been notified so that we don't cause confusion if we send 
their resume elsewhere.

Also, do you have references for Samantha? 

Please call me if you need any additional information.

Dick:

That will be fine.  However, you need to attach the trade confirmation (
marked Exhibit ""A"") to each of your certificates since that is how each
certificate is drafted.

Thus, for the April 12, 2001 transaction, please resend your certificates
with the appropriate attachments as referenced in the certificates.
Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks for ;your assistance.

From our end, we would like to have the direct reference to the specific
confirm.  I know it is a little more hassle, but it works better for us
politically.

I never heard back from you regarding my email of 4/18/01.  I had asked if
you would mind revising the forms of certificate which we will attach to
each trade confirmation.

We would appreciate revisions to the April 12, 2001 certificates.  This
will be the format for all future transactions.

Please send revisions to Kimberly Hundl.  Her phone number is (713)
853-1647 and fax if (713) 646-2443.

Dick:

I am suggesting a minor change to the ""Power Risk Management Committee""
certificate (to eliminate the reference to the Exhibit ""A"").  If we leave
the reference in the certificate, you will always have to label the confirm
as Exhibit ""A"" and resend the completed papers to us.  Please let me know
if you are alright with this change.  If so, we ask that you please resend
the certificate dated April 12, 2001.  If you do not wish to make the
change, please resend the two certificates to which the confirmation
labeled Exhibit ""A"" is attached.

Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Below is a link to the prepared testimony of Michael Travieso, Maryland People's Counsel, at the Barton RTO hearing last week.  His comments on the importance of a fewer number of RTOs, each with a broad geographic scope, track our own views.  As with the CFA report by Mark Cooper several months ago, these consumer groups are important to showing third party support for our efforts, particularly among Democrats in Congress.

The Pastoria DASH each of you signed last week has been modified at the 
request of Jeff Skilling and Rebecca Carter.  Late Friday afternoon, West 
Power was advised to value the gas transportation on a PV10 rather than VaR 
basis.  The impact of this change was to increase the cost of the gas 
transportation from $34MM to $102.3MM.  The $102.3MM is a worst-case scenario 
in that it assumes none of the capacity can be resold.

Also, RAC has advised that no new signatures will be required for the revised 
DASH.  

The revised DASH will be considered by the Enron Executive Committee this 
afternoon in a special meeting along with other projects.

Attached for you convenience are (1) the original DASH (DASH dev final 
dg.doc), (2) the final DASH before the Executive Committee 
(DASH_Pastoria4_030901) and (3) a redlined comparision of the final to the 
original (DASH_Pastoria4_0309091_redlined).  Most all highlighted changes 
reflect the substitution PV for VaR.  A few minor changes were also made.

Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at 
713.345.8992.

Vince,
 Per the dialogue below, there seems to be some agreement between our two 
groups that a subscription to the ""Institute for International Finance"" is 
worth receiving, but to do so in one central subscription and split the 
cost.  Is a $16K share OK for your group?  We'll do $32K on our end, and then 
try and sell some of our share to my European counterpart once he gets better 
established with a bigger budget.

I haven't heard back from VInce yet on the price, but we definitely need to 
continue our access to IIF.  Can you count us in for a slice of the cost and 
advise me how many others depts you can recruit to help pay the annual fees.  
Once you have a final count, it may reduce our costs in Research.  Thanks,

Robert,

Thanks for itemizing the costs.  We have decided to cancel the Oxford 
Analytica, as we receive a consensus forecast for currency and inflation from 
another source.  Regarding IIF, it is an important source for us.  I will 
discuss the costs within the Research Group and advise you of how we will 
proceed.

Subject: IIF/OxAn

Hi Maureen and Gwyn-

On the Oxford Analytica front, I'm glad you have found the service useful.  
Our contract with them has expired and we are currently negotiating for more 
users to have access.  Our current contract is for $50K or $10K per user per 
year.  We can charge $10K back to you.

On the IIF front, the invoice for $47K is due at the end of the month.  Here 
I would propose that we pay two thirds (to cover our costs and the costs of 
our Competitive Analysis colleagues in London), leaving $15K for you to cover.

Since we took on these services last year, we have expanded our range of 
sources and projects and are consequently trying to do more with less. Thus I 
need to allocate some of our costs from OxAn and IIF to other projects.

Let me know what you think about this proposal.  Maureen, congratulations on 
your secondment to Enron Metals (Gwyn mentioned it to me).  FYI, our 
colleague Jim Roth is providing Competitive Analysis support to Joe Gold and 
John Sherriff on that project from London.

RJ

In the spirit of Christmas, God bless you every one, but grades are not
changed after the fact.

I thought of you guys when I saw the announcement of Oldsmobile's
demise. Before you break your arm patting yourself on the back, let me
remind you that the assignment was to think about the basis for
attitudes and how one might changes attitudes, and, by giving up and
shutting down Oldsmobile, you were basically taking a whiff on the
assignment. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I'm tempted to
see if your grades can be reduced.

Anyway, it's good to hear from you. I hope that things are going well
for all of you.

	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

	David Oxley

=09 BROWN:  This is the battle of the game, in my opinion: OU's receivers v=

UT's secondary. If OU quarterback Josh Heupel goes unpressured, the UT=20
secondary might need therapy after this game. But Rod =20
=09
=09Babers and Quentin Jammer have made progress each game. If Lee Jackson i=
s=20
back, he'll play strong safety, and Greg Brown would move from SS back to=
=20
free safety. That means Dakarai Pearson goes back to the nickel back, which=
=20
in this game, is good news for UT. You need Pearson in the game as much as=

=09 BROWN:  I think the offenses are equal, so it will come down to who pla=
ys=20
the best defense. I think Texas has the better defense, even without Shaun=

Rogers. So I see Texas winning, 24-20. Turnovers will change the complexion=
=20
of the game, of course. But I think UT is catching OU at the right time aft=

picking up some much-needed confidence on offense against Oklahoma State.=

do you expect Major Applewhite to start and play the entire game against OU=

Also (looking ahead to next year because this year it is no longer an issue=
),=20
do you think Major Applewhite would be a legitimate Heisman Trophy candidat=
e=20
IF he were to start every game and take 90 percent of the snaps?=20
=09
=09My two cents ... I think the Texas coaches better start treating Major=
=20
Applewhite like one of the best college quarterbacks in the country, which =
he=20
obviously is, and start treating Chris Simms like the second-best quarterba=
ck=20
at the University of Texas, which he might be. (I say might because I haven=
't=20
seen Chance Mock play in a game. He might be better than Simms.)=20
=09 ?? Clint Mickey=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Major Applewhite will start against Oklahoma (based on repetiti=
ons=20
with the first team in practice this week) and I would be shocked if he=20
doesn't play most or all of this game. In fact, I think Major will play mos=
t=20
or all of the next two games.=20
=09
=09If UT beats OU, the Colorado game will be one of those nightmare games=
=20
because UT will be fighting a letdown and the Buffaloes will probably still=
=20
be winless (the Bufs play at A=02?this week).  So, these next two games are=
 all=20
about experience. But I think Simms will be back in action when UT takes on=
=20
Missouri on Oct. 21 because the coaches are sticking with the notion of=20
having two starting quarterbacks.=20
=09
=09I think Applewhite would be a Heisman Trophy candidate this season if he=
 had=20
been the lone starter. It's just impossible to think of yourself as the bes=
t=20
player in the nation, I would think, when your coaches don't think you're t=
he=20
best QB on your own team.=20
=09
=09As far as next year, you would have to think the coaches are going to=20

=09
=09It seems to me it would be less demeaning to Simms to name Applewhite as=

=09?? Rowell Rogers, Denton=20

=09 BROWN:  I talked to Major one-on-one on Monday, and he said he didn't=

on=20
of confidence by leading Texas on five straight scoring drives of the secon=

rotation, it will be interesting to see if Applewhite can continue to=20
maintain or build on the confidence he seized in the OSU game. =20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: What is happening with special teams? I know they have had some rece=
nt=20
success after missed tackles and have improved, but what I cannot understan=
d=20
is why the opposing team can get so close to Kris Stockton and UT, with=20

hurt us. How is our blocking so different? Why does this problem persist? =
=20
=09?? Chad Dieterichs=20

special teams players. And he says young players have to be used because=20
veterans get tired playing offense and defense.=20
=09
=09I asked Mack if he thought that members of the punt team were starting t=

said he didn't know. He said the latest punt block against Oklahoma State w=

=20

=09
=09In a year or two, we'll be right in there. So here's my question. What w=
ill=20
it take for Texas to be consistently rated up there with the great college=
=20
programs? Right now, as a friend of mine would say, we have a good team and=
=20
we're building a good program. It seems that Texas is heading in that=20
direction, but we have a little way yet to go. What does Texas need to be a=
=20
true Top 10 team? Is it personnel-based or is it about chemistry? =20
=09?? Alex Kephart, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think it has to do with chemistry and experience at this poin=
t.=20
The talent is there. Mack Brown is recruiting winners. But each of the line=
s=20
has to have experience, and there have to be some ""Braveheart""-type leaders=
=20
on the team.=20
=09
=09Right now, the offensive line is still growing, even though it has two=
=20
seniors. The defensive line has great senior tackles, but the ends are raw.=
=20
So the defensive line probably won't be great again after this year for a=
=20
couple years, if you believe that you need senior lines to win a national=
=20
championship.=20
=09
=09But I agree with you. Texas has all the makings of being a powerhouse in=
stead=20
of just a good team in the next two to three years. Everyone will put the=
=20
Longhorns back up in the Top 5 next year because of their schedule. But Tex=
as=20
will be a veteran team with great depth in the next two to three years.=20
=09
=09Right now, Texas and its fans and even the media have been guilty (me=20
included) of holding Texas to the same standard as Nebaraska and Florida=20
State. But that's probably not fair just yet. The stud players Brown is=20
recruiting need time to settle into the system and get some experience. In=

=09

The=20

=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I know the subject has been worn into the ground, but I haven't hear=
d=20
this view from anyone so ... In the mid-'90s Florida State was struggling=
=20
early in the season with a young, talented QB named Charlie Ward (of course=
).=20
They were winning the early games against less-talented teams, but just=20
barely. Then, they finally put Ward in the shotgun on virtually every down=
=20
and let him do his magic.=20
=09
=09It was like night and day.  Basically, what they did was abandon their m=
ore=20
balanced attack and did what their talent dictated they could do - pass ear=
ly=20
and often. The run was still used, but it was more to complement the pass.=
=20
=09
=09I know UT is not in the exact situation, but this may make sense for the=
m.=20
The only time I thought the UT offense looked really good this year was rig=
ht=20
when Major Applewhite first came in against Louisiana-Lafayette and drove=
=20
straight down the field. And, Major took almost every snap in the shotgun (=
at=20
least the first drive). I know it was against an inferior opponent that was=
=20
probably taken by surprise, but they showed more on those drives with Major=
=20
in the first and second quarter than they have the rest of the season (so=
=20
far).=20
=09
=09I believe you CAN win in college football with an unbalanced attack. FSU=
 has=20
done it with primarily passing, and I can't begin to name all the OU and=20
Nebraska-type teams that have won conference/national titles with=20
one-dimensional offenses. Also, the shotgun helps Major's biggest liability=
 -=20
his mobility. Personally, I don't care which QB is used this season - in th=
e=20
shotgun or not, but I really wish Mack Brown would just choose one and stic=
k=20
with him. =20
=09?? Aaron Ruhnow=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think you will continue to see the shotgun used only in speci=
fic=20
situations. The Texas coaches are too committed to being a balanced offense=
=20
that can run out of multiple sets. I do like the shotgun. The Buffalo Bills=
=20
used it all the time while they were going to all those Super Bowls. You ca=

up, we inevitably end up tearing it down. Maybe the sense is that the=20

re-evaluated and said, ""Wait, they really aren't that good.""
=09
=09Mack Brown had been telling people to reduce their expectations. But whe=
n the=20

to add their own wrinkle as to why it's falling. So people look for cracks =

=09

itself. But inevitably there is a settling period.
=09

of=20
having actually developed a line, since he inherited experienced lines at=

both Marshall and UT.=20
=09
=09This group clearly hasn't improved, even though it was a major source of=
=20
concern after last season. Nunez may be a fine coach and a great recruiter,=

country? Is he the one who we want developing the fine group of incoming li=
ne=20
recruits we have committed for next year?=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Patience. Don't fire a coach before it gets to mid-season. If t=

of two or three series each - in order to begin to establish some sort of=

consistency. (In your Sept. 25 column, you also said this should happen.) I=

the game, Chris Simms started, but was pulled early after an interception,=

=20
even wondered aloud if Simms was hurt in some way, since he didn't get back=
 =20
in until late in the game.=20
=09
=09My question is: Was this a message to Simms in some way, due to his poor=

ar=20
he hasn't won the job outright. Now, coaches have to decide if this rotatio=

is really the best thing for the team and its leadership. I think they will=
=20
rely more on Applewhite in the next two games and thus kind of disprove the=
ir=20
own theories about having two starters.=20
=09
=09The hard part about the public relations in this situation is that once =
you=20
say you have two starters, it's a real blow to one once you say that you no=
w=20
only have one starter. I think the coaches will continue to say they have t=
wo=20
starters and play Simms out of fear of an injury affecting Applewhite. I=20
don't know if that's the right answer. Applewhite grew on the job without a=
ny=20
game training before Richard Walton went down in 1998. So who knows?=20
=09
=09I would think the coaches will again rotate after the OU and Colorado ga=

because they will face teams (Missouri, Baylor, Texas Tech and Kansas) that=

Here is a quick, rough draft at a DASH for the MEH revolver.  You had 
indicated that a high level summary should suffice, so that is where I have 
started.  Please indicate where additional information should be included.  I 
didn't want to get too bogged down in the details unless necessary.  I have 
also included the draft cash management policy that I referred to in the 
DASH.  

Any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks,

Gregg

Hey Daren,

We're back on this issue again.  There is gas out there for days 1-3 and 6-20 
but the deal is only good for 21-31. 

Can you assist Anita and I w/a deal number to place the 1st 20 days on.  
Anita is attempting to close this issue.

As usual, thanks for your help.

Daren,

The above mentioned meter is on stranger's for the entire month of Jan. 
2000.  There is a deal ticket applicable to this meter from Jan. 21st thru 
the 31st.  Is it o.k. for Volume Management to apply volumes from the 21st 
thru the 31st to the 215?

I don't know what kind of issues was associated with this deal.

Thanks

Jackie,
I see that the gas at this meter is allocated to ""stranger's"" in POPS.   
Stephanie Gomes in Settlement thinks that this could be Encina's gas.  I see 
in Sitara that deal 152638 is only valid from the 21st - 31st.   Can you 
please take a look.

Hey Anita,
For meter # 0986725, 1/00 production, I am showing per meter statement that 
41,671mmbtu flowed.  Is that gas really Encina's.  Has the volume just not 
been allocated yet.  Could you let me know  what the deal is on the meter.

John:  The ""signature block"" for ENA and ECT Investments, Inc. trades done 
through the U.K. agent actually looks different.  It should read something 
like ""Company X, as agent for ENA"", for example.  Therefore, Insitnet needs 
to see the agency agreement between Company X and ENA (which is in the 
process of being drafted).  You are correct in that the original ENA/Instinet 
agreement will be utilized.  However, Instinet needs to review the agency 
arrangement before proceeding.

You are also correct about the ITG agreement.  In fact, ENA DOESN'T have an 
executed agreement with POSIT.  I spoke with the POSIT lawyer several months 
ago and was shocked that the service would operate without anything in 
writing.

Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

As ENA and ECT Investments, Inc., will be the entities where all trades are 
actually booked, I would not think that any new agreements would need to be 
signed between the new ""agent"" entitiy and any outside vendors (ie, brokers, 
online trading platforms, etc.)  The new entity will never take actual 
ownership of the securities.  Therefore, I would presume that the Instinet 
agreement should just be an addendum to existing documentation.  The 
Posit/ITG agreement will have to be an entirely new agreement because the 
ownership structure of ITG Europe is different than that of the States.  This 
agreement, however, should reflect exactly the same sort of 
structure/language as was used to negotiate the contract between ITG and ENA 
and ECT Investments, Inc. 

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks and regards,
John

John:  Hi, there!  As you are aware of the structuring for tax purposes, 
until the U.K. corporate agent is actuallly formed, there is nothing further 
that I can do.  That formation should happen today or tomorrow.  With the 
actual name and agreements with ENA and ECT Investments, Inc., I can provide 
that information to Instinet and the other trading platforms you are 
interested in transacting on.  Just FYI, the Instinet people are merely 
waiting for the agent agreement in order to proceed. 

Please let me know if you have any further questions.  Sara

Chris,

I haven't heard when they expect to have their financing.  We are finishing 
up the break out contract with GE, and assuming we tender it tomorrow, they 
will have until April 19th to fund the escrow.

Electricity Markets:  How Do They Work?

EEI's Energy Delivery Group presents a series of four workshops on the basics 
of electricity market design. Attend in person in Washington DC or in your 
office via live Webcast!

Mark Your Calendars!
April 26, May 18, May 24, and June 14
Hyatt Regency Washington, DC on Capitol Hill

How electricity markets work is vitally important, as California's 
well-publicized restructuring experience vividly demonstrates.  Many regions 
have made great progress in developing these markets to bring customers 
choice, lower cost power and new energy products.  Others are working to 
develop the institutions, regional transmission organizations (or RTOs), and 
the markets needed to support electric competition.

EEI is now offering a four workshop series on the basics of electricity 
market design. These workshops are specifically designed for policymakers and 
analysts developing restructuring policy who would benefit from a better 
understanding of market design basics.

The workshops will focus on the key questions and topics that define how 
markets are designed, evaluate alternative market structures and clarify 
where the industry is headed.  Attendees will benefit from the knowledge and 
expertise of nationally renowned experts dedicated to making complex issues 
understandable.

Mark, herewith the list I referred to in my last email.  I've looked to see 
if there are any CAs with a Duke entity with an Enron European entity and 
there are none.

We ought to come up with a streamlined procedure for approving new reference 
entities (rather than having it attacked contemporaneously on all sides by 
several departments).

I am working on a report aimed at Energy Marketers that will examine
Natural Gas Storage: Effects on Energy Trading. I am looking for people
who can talk about the importance of this subject to power marketers.
Please contact me if you can inform me on any of the following subjects.

I am interested in exploring the following issues:
1. Storage process: transportation, injection, withdrawal
2. Are all storage facilities connected to pipelines?
3. Description of types of storage facilities: salt caverns,
above-ground tanks, inactive underground volcano, others
4. Problems that limit underground reservoir effectiveness
5. Historical storage data
6. Contributing factors to storage levels: weather, generation demand,
reliability concerns
7. National map of storage facilities and capacities
8. Terms definitions: base gas, working gas, underground storage,
traditional storage, salt caverns, other relevant terms
9. Impact of storage fluctuations on prices and energy trading
10. Safety issues of natural gas storage
11. Seasonal storage trends
12. Total amount of national storage capacity
13.  Future storage capacity needs
14. LNG as storage alternative
15. Technology improvements
16. Who regulated natural gas storage?
17. List of storage facility owners

If you are involved with natural gas storage, or are an energy trader
who is affected by natural gas storage, please contact me by November
13th. Thank you in advance for your help!

Subject: CRRA LOI

I have a couple of questions so I can wrap up the LOI:

We refer to licensed Fuel Cell Energy equipment.  Do we intend to reference a 
particular manufacturer, or should this be more generic?

Do we want to attach a draft of the Development Agreement, and condition the 
final deal on agreeing to terms substantially the same as what's in the 
draft?  I have a concern that the Enron optionality bug could bite us on the 
backside with that one.

Do we expect to have ONE EPC contract, or several?  

I'm looking for the confidentiality agreement, which may be in Bart's files 
(haven't checked closely yet).  If anyone has it handy, it could speed things 
up for me.

Thanks,

Kay

Mike,

Boy, the more things change, the more they stay the same.... 

 You are correct that EOG does not give us the OK to ""go ahead"".  

EOG has agreed to wire funds to TW today to cover the cost of installing the 
EFM, quality monitoring equipment, and whatever additional cost we incurred.  
In typical EOG fashion however, they want everything done yesterday, after 
their actions delayed the activity by over a week.  To the extent we have the 
equipment available, and can install it, they would like to flow the gas as 
soon as possible.  Is it possible to hook up their well pending our securing 
all the equipment we need, or is the gas too bad to risk it?  They have gone 
ahead and told our Market Services people they are delivering the gas for 
tomorrow's gas day, and I suspect that is a little aggressive.  Do you have 
an idea when the gas will be available?

Thanks for your help, Bob"

SuperModels=20
Why Enron investors are running for the exits=20
It's all about risk -- and the Houston energy company may be on the hook fo=
r billions. Bailing now and taking $5 a share, sellers reason, is better th=
an getting only pennies in bankruptcy.=20
By Jon D. Markman <http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/bios.asp>=20

In normal circumstances, shares of Houston energy-trading titan Enron shoul=
d have stabilized around $10 after it agreed to a merger with crosstown riv=
al Dynegy earlier this month. Instead, the stock price is retreating faster=
 than the Taliban. Why?=20

The answer, like everything associated with Enron, is complex. But the shor=
t version is that investors fear that hidden problems will scotch the merge=
r and force Enron to seek bankruptcy protection, potentially leaving its sh=
ares worth pennies.

While attention has so far focused on credit problems related to ill-disclo=
sed limited partnerships, institutional investors are increasingly worried =
about risks Enron faces in the market for financial derivatives known as ""s=
waps."" Accentuating their concern: Billions of dollars' worth of Enron's ne=
ar-term swap contracts -- instruments that ironically were invented to help=
 corporations limit risk -- will reportedly mature next month and are even =
more hidden from investors' view than the deals that have gotten the firm i=
nto trouble so far. On Wednesday afternoon, the bond-rating agency Fitch up=
dated its opinion on Enron by stating it believed ""there have been signific=
ant cash collateral calls from wholesale trading customers well in excess o=
f previous expectations.""=20

Glenn Reynolds, chief executive of independent debt-research firm CreditSig=
hts and a former chief credit officer at Lehman Bros., said the swaps marke=
t is a very large but arcane investment arena that isn't followed by mainst=
ream corporate bond analysts or equity analysts. Yet, he noted, ""it's one o=
f the biggest things that can still go badly wrong for Enron.""

How much is Enron on the hook for?
Swaps exposure thus makes December a make-or-break month for the company, a=
s its counterparties in complex deals glued together with billions in borro=
wed funds frantically attempt to unwind positions in markets as disparate a=
s currency, natural gas, bonds and metals. If Enron either made the wrong b=
ets on too many of these deals, or contract covenants are breached that spu=
r demands for hard-asset or cash collateral, the company could be forced to=
 seek the protection of bankruptcy court to prevent a run on its dwindling =
treasury.

Moreover, because the world of swaps and derivatives is so incestuous -- wi=
th Company A able to pay its hundreds of millions in derivatives obligation=
s to Company B only after it receives payments from Company C - some trader=
s worry that Enron's potential inability to pay off on its swaps liabilitie=
s could threaten the stability of the world's commodity-trading system.=20

No one is saying that this worst-case scenario is bound to happen. But rumo=
rs of default risk can spread like financial smallpox in nervous markets --=
 even if they're never proved true. One story making the rounds on trading =
floors, for instance, tied the historic collapse of U.S. government bonds i=
n the third week of November to the belief that Enron had to sell vast quan=
tities of short-term Treasury notes to make good on swap-related margin cal=
ls. (Enron officials did not return calls for comment.)

Experts noted that Enron's counterparty risks and scant disclosure on high =
levels of borrowing remind them of the spectacular blowup of hedge fund Lon=
g-Term Capital Management in 1998, which imperiled the world capital market=
s until the Federal Reserve captained a bailout. That debacle ended when on=
ce-generous banks and brokerages finally turned off the money spigot. Said =
one veteran portfolio manager, who asked not to be identified: ""This is sha=
ping up to be LTCM 2. If Enron's lines of credit dry up, they're out of bus=
iness -- end of story.""

Lots of credit and lots of deals
To understand the problem more clearly it's important to understand what En=
ron does for a living, and the role and utility of swaps.=20

Many investors think of Enron as an energy company or gas utility, but it h=
as really operated more like a combination investment bank, market maker an=
d hedge fund in the past few years. One of the key ways it earned income wa=
s its role in selling risk-management instruments -- those swaps -- as a so=
lution for whatever financial impairments that a company fretted over.=20

Let's say you run the risk-management operation of a metal-mining firm and =
you're long copper futures as a hedge against the possibility that prices m=
ight fall in six months. You want to lock in the price, so you enter into a=
 swap with Enron under rules of the International Swap Dealers Agreement, o=
r ISDA. Accounting protocols allow you to keep this trade off your balance =
sheet, so it's not disclosed anywhere for competitors, or investors, to mon=
itor. One of Enron's roles was to find a company with the opposite problem =
to yours -- let's say they want to be short copper futures -- and make the =
match. Thus Enron helped you swap a risk that made you uncomfortable for a =
risk that you felt you could control.=20

More often, Enron reportedly took the swap itself and laid off the risk by =
using some other hedge, such as being long or short Eurodollars or U.S. Tre=
asury notes. It might also find it profitable to be the one responsible for=
 actually delivering the physical product. At its peak, Enron is said to ha=
ve been a counterparty on thousands of swaps per week.

This business requires massive amounts of credit -- also known as ""leverage=
"" -- because margins are slim; the only way to become super-successful is t=
o do really big volume. It turned out that few of Long-Term Credit Manageme=
nt's counterparties or bank lenders understood that the hedge fund had leve=
raged itself by as much as 30:1 because of similar efforts to trade in high=
 volume. And likewise, one veteran analyst who asked not to be identified t=
old me that he believes Enron might have been leveraged by as much as an as=
tronomical 100:1 in some cases.

Thomas Seims, chief economist at the Federal Reserve in Dallas and an autho=
rity on swaps, told me that the crux of the issue is, ""Do we know exactly w=
hat their positions are -- and did they use swaps and leverage properly or =
improperly? When we find out, we can determine the potential for a contagio=
n effect.""=20

The big question: How many deals?
Why don't we know what their positions are? Legally, they're not required t=
o reveal them -- and we already know that Enron has done an absolutely terr=
ible job of disclosing information that securities laws and investment comm=
unity conventions actually require. Swaps are similar to the proprietary tr=
ading operation of major brokerages, but with one critical difference. Typi=
cally stocks are fairly liquid and transaction terms do not vary much. But =
swap contracts can have all sorts of covenants related to the creditworthin=
ess of the counterparties. So for all anyone outside of Houston knows, ther=
e could be any number of billion-dollar deals hanging out there with rules =
that require Enron to put up collateral or pay off loans if their debt rati=
ng falls below a certain rating threshold, such as BBB-, one step above jun=
k. The surprise disclosure of such a clause in a previously hidden limited =
partnership contract over a Brazilian deal is what caused Enron's stock to =
plunge 20% on Tuesday, according to traders.=20

More importantly, one financial services executive pointed out, because Enr=
on owns the market for many swaps, spread options and other thinly traded f=
inancial instruments, they're the ones who set the mark-to-market price tha=
t shows on their profit-and-loss statement. For example, every night an Enr=
on trader must mark the value of a 15-year Chicago natural-gas swap on his =
books. There is no closing or settlement price -- there's only what the Enr=
on trader thinks the price should be. It is in these mark-to-market prices =
of thousands of swap positions that Enron could theoretically hide hundreds=
 of millions in unrealized losses, if it chose to.=20

One prominent New York consultant to the energy risk-management industry to=
ld me he's estimated that Enron could be forced to write off as much $1 bil=
lion or more in failures related to its swap transactions. Why hasn't anyon=
e focused on it? ""The magnitude of Enron's partnership problems is so great=
 that after awhile you get numb, and no one is paying attention to this par=
t of their operation.""

Philip K. Verleger Jr., a leading energy-industry economist and consultant,=
 also noted that one reason that Enron risks aren't easily quantified is th=
at they ""may not be price independent."" That's an economist's way of pointi=
ng out that the company -- a major player in a corner of the derivatives bu=
siness called ""delta hedging"" -- may not have the capital required to maint=
ain a futures position in all the puts or calls it sold to commodity produc=
ers trying to offset risks that the price of things like natural gas or oil=
 might fall or rise sharply. If prices maintain above or below a level that=
 Enron forecast as likely to make it money in such a transaction, no proble=
m. But if prices in the commodity change unexpectedly -- as oil prices did =
earlier this month -- then Enron could find itself deep in the hole and for=
ced to lean on thinning lines of credit to pay its obligation.

Whirlwind merger deal no reassurance
Verleger isn't mollified by the notion that Dynegy, which agreed to merge w=
ith Enron, has studied the company's trading book thoroughly and decided it=
 was fine. ""Dynegy probably was not able to see its whole book in a week,"" =
he said. Added another trader, who declined to be identified: ""How anyone c=
ould do such fast due diligence is beyond me completely."" Another trader sp=
eculated that auditors at Dynegy -- a much smaller firm -- may have initial=
ly given Enron a free pass on some disclosures because it was considered on=
e of the cleverest and best-connected companies in the nation, with a chief=
 executive who was a major financial backer and friend of President George =
W. Bush.

Reynolds, the CreditSights executive, said that investors should beware wha=
t he calls ""omission risk"" -- or the simple fact that ""what you don't see i=
s what gets you every time."" He points out, for instance, that Enron had a =
chance to tell investors about its ratings-related exposure in the Brazilia=
n deal during a conference call with investors last week, but didn't. ""It b=
oggles the mind"" that they have kicked away every opportunity to rebuild co=
nfidence and credibility, he said.

So what if gremlins pop out of the swaps closet? Reynolds believes that Dyn=
egy will use broadly written escape clauses in its merger agreement to walk=
 away from its Enron merger if unexpected swap defaults -- called ""fails"" i=
n the business -- emerge. He believes that Enron would then find it necessa=
ry to seek the protection of bankruptcy court, because no other merger part=
ner or bank is likely to follow in Dynegy's footsteps to the altar.

In that event, Reynolds estimates Enron's stock -- which traded for $85 a y=
ear ago -- could quickly sink to less than $2 from its current perch in the=
 mid-single digits. Since holders of more than 80 bonds and senior bank loa=
ns would stand ahead of shareholders in bankruptcy proceedings, however, he=
 speculated that Enron shareholders would be lucky to end up with pennies.=

Sandi,
I left Parquet a few v-mails on this.  I haven't heard back, but I assume he 
is still interested in retaining local control of property taxes. Since you 
handled this last time, I assume you'd do the same this time. Can you be on

		 Subject: Creation of IEP Property Tax Subcommittee; Conference Call 
Scheduled for 9:30 a.m. (PST) on Thursday, May 31


The IEP Regulatory Affairs Committee approved the creation of a new,
Property Tax Subcommittee.  The Regulatory Affairs Committee is noticing the
entire IEP membership inviting participation by all the commpanies
interested in property tax matters.

Last week, Controller Connell indicated an interest in shifting the
jurisdiction over property tax assessment applied to electric generators
from the local level to the State Board of Equalization (SBE).  IEP engaged
in this matter in 1998/1999.  Attached is a brief summary memo of the key
issues at that time.  At that time, IEP successfully argued for retaining
jurisdictional authority at the local level.

The SBE may take this issue up at its June 20, 2001 meeting.  The SBE is
comprised of five voting members.  The membership is divided 3:2 between
democrats and republicans.

The initial meeting of the Subcommittee will be a conference call scheduled
for 9:30 a.m. (PST) on Thursday, May 31.  During this meeting, we will be
discussing policy positions and/or statements that IEP may wish to take, as
well as any tactical matters to be addressed at this time.

The conference call-in number is  800/486-2460
The Call-in Number is    111756

Hey, Mom.

I got your e-mail just fine.  Is your computer fixed up now?  

Cole had a great time at his birthday party last night.  When we were walking 
out of Chuck E Cheese after the party, Cole asked me ""Daddy, am I three 
now?""  He got some good presents and got to play alot of games.  It took him 
forever to go to sleep.  He really loved the Blues Clues game ya'll got him.  
The packaging was coming open when he got it yesterday, so Tonya let him open 
it before the party.  He played it in the car going to the party and on the 
way home.  I think I'm tired of that game.  He can't play it in the car 
anymore.  It so funny to watch him play though.  He will repeat the question 
and go ""hmm"".  Anyway I need to go.

OK Zuc - you had to drag up one of indiscretions that landed us in jail, now you have to bring up our altercation in Tiger Stadium that got us thrown out?  If I remember correctly, we seemed not to be good influences on each other.  My fondest memory of our jailtime was the guy who stood above us as we slept on the floor and he was peeing and farting for about 10 minutes straight - or maybe it was the guy the next morning to whom you were handcuffed as we were led into court who decided he needed to get himself off while we were waiting in the holding cell.  I don't know why you were so wigged out about it.  At least he didn't throw up on you in court.  
 
I thought I escaped my sordid other life..........

I wonder how much the 'Stately Oak' grew during the past year? Oops! My bad!
I almost forgot that it was mysteriously cut down during an early '80's FIJI
Island pre-decorating/design phase. Has anyone ever fessed up to the
slaying? It sure did cause a terrible stir! If I remember correctly, the
cabinet considered canceling the Island unless the culprit confessed! This
may be a good topic of discussion? Maybe we could solve the mystery once and
for all?
And Bone, the arrest was a major event for at least three of us, me, Curt
and Tan Dan who came to court the next morning to bail us out! If that
arrest didn't make it, maybe the one when I got arrested for disturbing the
peace in Tiger Stadium during the '81 homecoming game against Fla. St. did?
At least the cops didn't beat me as bad as FSU beat the football team that
night! Or maybe Dan's 1st DWI made it? I'll let Dan tell that story.
Hope all you guys are doing well!

Brothers,   (Oct. 16)
Last night I received orders to report for duty this Thursday for up to 24
months.  As some of you may know, I command a Army Reserve unit in Dallas
TX.   I had just moved to Chicago two weeks ago to take a position within my
company, so this is inconvenient and with a very large pay cut, but I add, I
am very proud to be leading 90 of our finest soldiers into whatever mission
is delivered to us.  Due to operational Security(OPSEC), I can't talk much
about what I do, just keep me and my soldiers in your thoughts, and I will
join you at Pig Dinner 2003 or 2004.

Speaking of Brother Bonin, I'll recount a story during our Hellweek that all
can probably relate to.  Brother Bonin was the assistant Pledge Trainer for
our class in 77-78. Our Hellweek coincided with JamJam and, as slave labor,
we were unloading a truck of tables/chairs at a sorority house. One of the
sorority girls told Brother Bonin that the ""pledges"" could put the tables in
a certain spot. He corrected the girl by saying they aren't pledges.  When
the girl left, I asked Brother Bonin that if we aren't actives and we aren't
pledges, what are we?  Brother Bonin looked me in the eye and said, ""You're
SCUM!""
Post Toasties, Man

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lots of news the past couple of weeks.  First, Godspeed to Brother Jeff
Farris.  I know we all wish him a very safe tour.  Second, congrats to the
""Outlaw"" for his new baby boy.
Sounds like a lot of people will be in town for Ole Miss--Squid, Tan Dan
(The Worstells) and others.  Let me know who all is coming and maybe we can
all meet some place before or after the game.
Thanks to the 60 Brothers who have signed up for the Yahoo Group.  All the
past History that Brothers Slay & Bonin is helping us relive is posted
there.

Just curious how I may assist in getting Auburn University's name added to

The $1.3 trillion tax cut which is frequently quoted by the press is over 10 
years, the $460 tax cut below is over five years.

I looked into the proposed tax cut by George W. Bush.  On his website he 
proposes a $460 billion tax cut over five years. 
 The $213 billion ""energy tax"" imposed  from 1999 to 2001 by higher energy 
prices, is roughly half of Bush's proposed tax cut.

day less than the November average of 3,130, which is still the Life to Date 
high.  The overall average daily EOL volumes have remained steady as well.

*  The East and Central Regions of North American Gas have been the main 
reason EOL Gas transactions have remained steady.  The East Region has 
increased its overall average daily EOL deal count by about 20% since 
January, from 632 to 798 deals per day.  The Central Region has increased its 
overall average daily EOL deal count by about 50% since January, from 676 to 
1,018 deals per day.

*  US Power trading via EOL has now levelled off to average daily EOL Deal 
Count of about 452 deals per day.   This is mostly up from 181 deals per day 
in December, to 340 in January, to 449 in February.  In addition, the average 
daily Non-EOL Deal Count has also levelled off at about 483 deals per day.  
The average daily EOL volumes have remained fairly steady.

*  US East Power trading via EOL has now dropped off since February.  It has 
decreased its average daily EOL Deal Count by about 13% since February, from 
359 deals per day to 313.  In addition, the average daily Non-EOL Deal Count 
has now decreased by about 7% since February, from 269 to 250 deals per day.  
The average daily EOL volumes have remained steady.

*  UK Gas trading has continued to see a steady increase since December on 
EOL.  They were averaging close to 51 transactions per day in December 2000.  
Recently they have been climbing to 81 deals per day in January, 111 in 
February, and now 167 in March.  This represents about a 227% increase.

*  LPG's has decreased its total monthly EOL deal count from a consistent 450 
trades or so from November through January, to only 250 trades in the month 
of February, and only about 84 trades so far in the month of March .  This 
represents about a 62% decrease from previous months.  The total monthly EOL 
volumes have decreased similarly as well.

*  Enron Metals trades done via EOL has increased since February, from a 
daily average of 497 to a daily average of 629 for March.  This represents 
about a 27% increase.  The average daily EOL volumes have increased as well.

Hey man!  Haven't talked to you in awhile.  Hope things are good.  David
reminded me about the game the other day.  Are you still headed to Spain
for Thanksgiving?  If so, let me know when you want to get together and do
the ticket/money swap.  I'll be in Florida this weekend, but should be home
on weekends after that for awhile.  Or, we can do it one week night if I'm
in town.  Unfortunately, my travel schedule is not slowing down around the
holidays like I'd hoped.

I also have another favor to ask - is there any chance you would go to our
Christmas party with me on Dec 8 if I go?  David will obviously be there,
too.  I'm such a loser that I've had to go by myself the last three years
and that's such a drag.  Let me know if you think you'd consider it.

Guys, I appreciate the quality work and deal flow that you are generating.  
In an effort to measure and reward performance from our middle market groups 
we have attempted to come up with several standardized reports to be issued 
monthly and to be reviewed at the QBR.  I am a strong believer in that what 
is measured and rewarded gets done.  As well, the middle market capability is 
crucial to the continued growth of our business; therefore, reporting metrics 
which define high performance will ensure great deal makers get rewarded and 
that  you will be able to attract high quality talent into the mid market 
groups.  Baughman and Presto have created a number of reports and metrics for 
the East Power group, I would like you to take a look and let me know how 
they should be changed to reflect the business in the West.  Upon agreement 
on the metrics, I would like issue these reports on a monthly basis.

Tammy Sheppherd will get you a copy of the reports/metrics utilized in the 
East.

Regards
Delainey

Subject: EPMI WEST - Recent Trades with Long term Duration

Dave/John:

As you know, EPMI West recently has closed numerous longer-dated transactions 
(through 2002 and beyond) with munis and other direct counterparties (not 
marketers).  Several of these resulted due to close coordination between the 
Originator from Chris Calger's Group, the Middle Marketer and the Trader, 
each with a different role, working out the split of origination to 
everyone's satisfaction. Tim Belden (see below) thought you might be 
interested in the attached spreadsheet listing some of these key deals done 
this year.  

Please let me know if you want further details on the transactions 
(503/464-3822).

Thanks!

Chris

Could you please send an e-mail to Delainey, Lavorato, and Calger summarizing 
our long term deals done this year.  It should be pretty short with just the 
facts.  The deals I can think of are Kaiser, Roseville, Santa Clara, Redding, 
and Merced.  They didn't ask for it, but I think it would be nice to do a 
quick, short, sweet piece of Portland Orig/Middle Market PR.  Let me know

UCLA FORECASTERS SEE NATIONAL RECESSION AS INEVITABLE IN 2001; CALIFORNIA 
WILL NOT BE IMMUNE, WITH BAY AREA VERY SUSCEPTIBLE





? 
LOS ANGELES --Economists with the UCLA Anderson Business Forecast see even 
more clear indicators of a recession for the nation in 2001 and project a 90 
percent chance that the nation's longest economic expansion will come to an 
end no later than the first quarter of 2002. 
""The year 2001 is a transition year that will take the U.S. economy from the 
Internet Rush of 1996-2000 to a lower level of sustainable economic growth in 
2002,"" said Edward Leamer, UCLA Anderson Business Forecast director and 
Anderson School professor. However, getting from here to there will involve 
some painful adjustments, he warns, and ""monetary medicine"" from the Fed 
won't stop the pain this time.
According to the econometric model used by UCLA's forecasters, the 
probability of a 2001 recession has increased nearly 30 percent since 
December 2000. Just three months ago, Dr. Leamer's forewarning of a recession 
was the most pessimistic -- and, as it turns out, the most accurate forecast 
made that quarter. 
""The expansion of 1999-2000 was driven by 'New Economy' investment 
opportunities. Firms rushed pell-mell to be the first kid on the block to 
have a cool website. Fear was a big motivator. Internet firms feared losing 
first-mover advantage. Bricks-and-mortar firms feared they would lose out to 
pure Internet business models. Almost every enterprise in the U.S. invested 
heavily in IT equipment and software, and hired the associated personnel,"" 
said Dr. Leamer. ""Things are different now."" 
The national recession and slowdown in investment in information technology 
and software has different implications for the principal regions of 
California. A recession is quite likely for the Bay Area, while Southern 
California will experience many economic stresses though skirting an outright 
recession. 
Dr. Tom Lieser, author of the California Forecast, expects to see a 
""high-tech"" recession in California that will have a disproportionate impact 
on the San Francisco Bay Area. ""We will most likely see not only a slowing of 
demand for electronics, communications equipment and related products, but 
also a weeding out of the less well-capitalized firms in these industries,"" 
said Dr. Lieser. 
The UCLA economist also expects a weak expansion in employment through 2002, 
with a corresponding rise in unemployment rates. A substantial slowdown in 
the California service sector -- a mainstay of the state's economic growth -- 
is also quite likely. 
""The strong increase in residential building permits seen during the 
November-January period will likely be short-lived,"" said Dr. Lieser. ""We 
expect to see declining home prices in the Bay Area this year. Southern 
California will also experience slower home sales and a lower rate of price 
increases."" 
Higher energy prices, the economists argue, may pose a greater problem for 
other states than for California, because of the state's lower per capita 
consumption. On a per capita basis, California ranked 49th out of 50 in 
electricity consumption and 26th in natural gas consumption, both in 1999. 
Even with the state's notorious dependence on the automobile, it still ranks 
only 15th out of the 47 reporting states in per capita gasoline consumption. 
And while the recent brownouts and blackouts may not perceptibly affect 
California incomes and employment in the short term, a prolonged electricity 
crisis could discourage business expansion significantly in the longer run.
The UCLA Anderson Business Forecast is the most widely followed and 
often-cited forecast for the state of California, and was unique in 
predicting both the seriousness of the early-1990s downturn in California and 
Southern California, and the strength of the state economy's rebound since 
1993. 
The Forecast was presented at an all-day conference at Korn Convocation Hall 
at The Anderson School at UCLA. In addition to providing the outlook for the 
state and national economy, the conference examined the economic impact of 
California's energy crisis through a series of panels led by some of the 
nation's most prominent authorities. Speakers included Loretta Lynch, 
president of the California Public Utilities Commission, Mark Bernstein, 
senior policy analyst at RAND Corporation, Barry Sedlik, manager, economic 
and business development, Southern California Edison, and Joseph M. Otting, 
executive vice president, Union Bank of California.

Monica,
This looks ok, but I can give you more accurate and more up to date slides 
for the future.  One important fact, we do not distibute the EOL slides to 
the general public.  Normally what we do is present the story but do not 
include hard copies with the conference hand outs.

Summary of Energy Technology Bulletin:

* Siemens Westinghouse and four European utilities have formed a
consortium to build a 1 MW hybrid power generation plant that will combine a
Siemens solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and a microturbine, which will be
supplied by the consortium utilities.  The unit will be tested as a
pre-commercial system for the European market and is expected to be in
operation by October 2003 at an Energie Baden-Wurttenberg AG (EnBW) facility
in Marbach, Germany.
* Two European utilities have awarded Siemens Westinghouse contracts
for their tubular solid oxide fuel cell system.  The two pre-commercial
units, one of which will be delivered to RWE Power AG in Essen (February
2002) and the other to Edison Spa in Milan (September 2002), will be 300kW
hybrid systems incorporating a microturbine and operating on natural gas.
* Real estate companies Arden Realty, CALPERS and RREEF dedicated two
large commercial solar power systems yesterday in Los Angeles.  The first
installation features nearly an acre of photovoltaic panels located on the
roof of a three-story office building owned by Arden Realty while the second
is located on an industrial building in Carlsbad, CA that is jointly owned
by CALPERS and RREEF (joint venture company is named CalWest Industrial
Properties).  Real Energy Corporation will sell the power generated by these
systems to the respective building owners.  Edison Development Corp., a
subsidiary of DTE Energy, supplied the solar panels that were built and
installed by PowerLight Corporation.

I was at the Senate hearing today on FERC's market Monitoring and Mitigation 
order, and I would add only a few additional and interesting 
regulatory-related details to John's fine summary:

The hearing was contentious- among the Senators themselves, among the FERC 
Commissioners themselves, and the interchanges between them.

Gas prices were controversial.  Commissioner Massey kicked off the discussion 
on this issue citing a transport basis differential into CA of $10, when it 
was less than a dollar in other areas.  He then noted that the high gas cost 
would adversely affect the power price under the auction, and that FERC must 
act regarding the high transport differentials- ""We will never get a handle 
on electric prices unless we get a handle on gas prices"".  That opened the 
floodgates of discussion, culminating with the announcement by Commissioner 
Breathitt of FERC's technical conference (notice of which issued today) on 
the topic of current and projected interstate pipeline capacity, and adequacy 
of infrastructure within CA.  She said that this would shed light on basis 
differentials and gas prices.

Freudian slip?  Chairman Hebert was heard to say by various attendees that 
price mitigation in the WSCC would apply at all times (in contrast to the 
order, which proposes mitigation only during times when reserves reach/fall 
below 7%).  Whether he mis-spoke, or not, remains to be seen.  

Regarding the issue of how often mitigation would be invoked in CA (i.e., 
Stages 1, 2 or 3):
 Hebert opined ""Most of the time"".
 Breathitt said ""Likely 80-85% of the time"".
 Massey was unconvinced.

Several Senators railed at the Commission for ""not doing its job"" and 
threatened that if the Commission did not act, Congress would act.

If you have any questions or need additional detail, please feel free to 
call.  Ray

Subject: House and Senate Energy Hearings Today on California/Western 
Electric Situation

I attended both the House and Senate energy committee hearings today.  House 
hearing was in the Barton Subcommittee (Energy & Air Quality).  Senate 
hearing was on last week's FERC order on a ""soft price cap"" and related 
issues.  The House witnesses were dominated by California officials: Cal 
Energy Commission, Cal Air Resources Board, Chairman of Gov Davis Generation 
Implementation Task Force.  In addition, there were witnesses from the 
Western Area Power Admin and Bonneville PA.  The Senate witnesses were the 
three FERC commissioners.

HIghlights

Chairman Barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the Barton 
bill, H.R. 1647 next week (many on and off the Subcommittee doubt this will 
happen; we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and will 
report back with more information and conclusions once that is done); 
Chairman Barton also said he may go to California next week.
There was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role that 
higher natural gas prices into California play in the electric power rate 
increases; several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportation 
costs for similar differences between California and non-CA states; FERC at 
the Senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technical 
conference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market as 
it relates to California; a House member from Southern Illinois coal country 
attacked California for using only natural gas in its new power plants.
The House witnesses, primarily BPA but also the California witnesses, 
attacked the negawatt provision in sec. 102 of the Barton bill; the criticism 
was that BPA would be forced to purchase power on the open market at a high 
price since it is short, sell it to the DSIs under contract; let the DSI sell 
it at market rates and capture the difference; BPA witness said that thus 
sec. 102 would make it difficult if not impossible to implement their 
strategy to avoid as much as a 200 percent rate increase on 10/1/01; BPA 
testimony will make it tough for Members of Congress from that service region 
to support sec. 102.
Both hearings also touched on how difficult it would be to actually devise a 
price cap; at the House hearing, none of those advocating a price cap among 
the witnesses could answer excellent questions about exactly how this could 
be done; the witnesses just said ""cost plus a reasonable profit"" and said 
leave the details to FERC; at afternoon Senate hearing, Chairman Hebert had 
the staff bring in 15 boxes from one FP&L case to show how a price cap would 
take too long to bring any relief to California this summer; he said last 
week's soft price cap is much better.
Also on the price cap, Rep. Walden (R-OR)  got the Cal Energy Comm chair to 
admit that if the price caps had been in place earlier, California would NOT 
have taken the conservation and new generation steps that it has taken 
recently. 
The interplay among the FERC commissioners was much more contentious than it 
was a House hearing on Tuesday, although it could have been worse; when 
Senate Chairman Murkowski (R-AK) said that ""help is on the way"" in the form 
of the nominees for the two vacancies, Sen. Dorgan (D-ND) made a comment that 
suggested that the confirmation process will not be smooth; the same concern 
came from the interplay among the Senators, which was also somewhat 
contentious at times.

Please advise if you have any questions or would like further details.

Vince,

I have made bold face edits to the attached document.  I still have two edits 
to make but am concerned that you were not reading the most recent version.  
Sorry for any confusion but the editor doesn't use the edit function in word 
so I have ended up making edits on new versions of the paper.  

I still haven't made the change regarding the take-or-pay problem (I left 
that paper at home in my briefcase and will make the change tomorrow 
morning).  Also, I haven't added anything regarding the conflict that arose 
over pay for new hires nor have I received the Business Week e-mail from you.

However, if the paper looks ok to Mark Palmer we can make these minor edits 
on the galley pages of the article.  

thanks

john

p.s. i am very disappointed about the scheduling conflict you have on Feb 
23rd.  you will be greatly missed but i certainly understand.

Per our discussion last week, this is the status on Pueblo.  I think we need 
to establish to our satisfaction the bona fides of Dennis' government 
contracting scheme before we pitch hard to have ENA get into the deal and 
scrub down the numbers on the power plant.  If our govcon gurus (Bill Votaw 
and Bill Gang--both ex military guys working on DOD outsourcing deals for 
Enron Federal Solutions) buy off on it, then I think we brief Stan at that 
point.  You, Stan and Steve will then need to decide the best way to pitch 
ENA to verify the economics and potentially get into the deal.  Either we'd 
have Stan push from the top down or have Kevin and  Steve go directly to the 
ENA deal guys.  More to follow.

Subject: Pueblo

I just talked to Tino Monaldo, Dennis Langley's lawyer/project manager for 
the Pueblo project.  I explained Bill and Bill's credentials and concerns and 
Tino suggested that a sit down between Enron and their government contracts 
team might be helpful.  He offered to do it in Houston, probably late next 
week or the following week.  Attending would be Dennis, Tino, and their 
outside lawyers, Jim Slattery and Rick Harrington.  Harrington is the key--he 
is a retired military guy and one of the lead govt. contracts lawyers at my 
old firm in DC.  The would basically put on a dog and pony walking us all 
through their sole source strategy,  including their legal interpretations 
and the allies they have lined up within DOE/DOD.  Bill and Bill--does such a 
meeting sound productive?  If so, should we have outside govt. contracts 
counsel present and if so, who do you suggest?  

On a related note, Tino explained (without me asking or really caring) that 
he was in the middle of a ""big drafting project""--revising Dennis' joint 
venture agreement with the Isleta.  I took the opportunity to express my 
concern at how far down the road Dennis is getting on the overall deal, 
including structure issues, without knowing whether Enron is even on board.  
I reminded Tino that GPG has not committed to participating in the pipeline 
or the power plant, and that we have not obtained ENA's agreement to commit 
turbines.   Apparently Dennis believes that if the economics pans out, Enron 
or someone else yet to be identified will magically jump in to the deal with 
money, turbines, etc.   If Enron does eventually decide to get into this 
deal, the agreements and promises that Dennis has already made may need to be 
revisited.   Thanks for your patience on this project.  DF

I know it's crazy around here, but if you have time to review the attached 
documents (they're short), I would appreciate your comments (especially since 
you've witnessed a focus group before).  They are the messages and focus 
group guide for Tuesday/Wednesday NY research.

I'll be here all day Monday if you want to get me comments by then.  

Thank you.

Janet, I completely disagree with legals position.  I have difficulty with 
some of our VP's having signing authority.  I believe this is a significant 
control issue.

Mark, is this widespread in ENA?

Well, I talked with legal about this and I understand that they can and do 
give signature authority to directors on a relatively frequent basis. I gave 
them the parameters for Ben to make it even easier. If they end up saying 
it's a bigger issue than originally articulated, I'll continue with Ben as we 
currently have it.  Thanks.

I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE
END! - follow what it says to the letter - and you
will not worry whether a RECESSION is coming or
not, who is President,or whether you keep your
current job or not . Yes, I know what you are
thinking. I never responded to one of these before
either. One day

though, something just said ""you throw away $25.00
going to a movie for 2 hours with your wife"".
""What the heck."" Believe me, no matter where you
believe ""those feelings"" come from, I thank
goodness every day that I had that feeling. I
cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word
of it. It is legal. I checked. Simply because you
are buying and selling something of value.

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:

Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET !
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A
YEAR!!!

Before you say ''Bull'', please read the
following. This is the letter you have been
hearing about on the news lately. Due to the
popularity of this letter on the Internet, a
national weekly news program recently devoted an
entire show to the investigation of this program
described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether
or not the program was legal.

Their findings proved once and for all that there
are ''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the
participation in the program and if people can
""follow the simple instruction"" they are bound to
make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket
cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY &
RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY
WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.

This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this
profitable opportunity"". I was approached many
times before but each time I passed on it. I am so
glad I finally joined just to see what one could
expect in return for the minimal effort and money
required. To my astonishment, I received a total $
610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming
in''. Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: ""this program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a
total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.'' More testimonials
later but first, =======

==== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ====
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read
the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN !!!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR
FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!

INSTRUCTIONS:

===Order all 5 reports shown on the list below===

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER
OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL
ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT
LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN
ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in
case of any mail problems.

===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE === ===YOU
ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! === You will need all
5 reports so that you can save them on your
computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 =
$25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail,
each of the 5 reports from these 5 different
individuals. Save them on your computer so they
will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's
of people who will order them from you. Also make
a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk
in case something happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people
who are listed next to each report, or their
sequence on the list, in any way other than what
is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or
you will loose out on the majority of your
profits. Once you understand the way this works,
you will also see how it does not work if you
change it. Remember, this method has been tested,
and if you alter it, it will NOT work !!! People
have tried to put their friends/relatives names on
all five thinking they could get all the money.
But it does not work this way. Believe us, some
have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened.
So Do Not try to change anything other than what
is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work
for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!
This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.

1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take
this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address
of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made
it through the cycle and is no doubt counting
their fortune.

2..Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO
REPORT # 5.

3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO
REPORT # 4.

4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO
REPORT # 3.

5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO
REPORT # 2

6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1
Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.

==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer. DO
NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case if you
loose any data. To assist you with marketing your
business on the internet, the 5 reports you
purchase will provide you with invaluable
marketing information which includes how to send
bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of
free classified ads and much more. There are 2
Primary methods to get this venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to
see how it goes, and we will assume You and those
involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's
also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.2%
(2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much
better but let's just say it is only 0.2%). Also
many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-
mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with
this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.

With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for
report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending
out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out
of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with
orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered
Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a
total of 5 million e-mail sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 +

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A
LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-
mails each or more? There are over 150 million
people on the Internet worldwide and counting,
with thousands more coming on line every day.
Believe me, many people will do just that, and
more!

METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive
and there are hundreds of FREE places to
advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the
Internet will easily get a larger response. We
strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add
METHOD #2 as you go along. For every $5 you
receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report
they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day
service on all orders.

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they can not advertise until they receive
the report.

===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about
time. Time for checks or credit cards to be
cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it is simply
so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope
and steal it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2
sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper,
Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are
ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and
postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3
weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or
more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue
advertising or sending e-mails until you do.

**Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will
continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO
REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on
the list, you are placed in front of a Different
report.

You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching
which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU
WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF
E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There
is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from
this business !!!

=================================================

FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS
PROGRAM: You have just received information that
can give you financial freedom for the rest of
your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF
EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few
weeks and months than you have ever imagined.
Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not
change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as
it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in Report
#1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as instructed
above. One of the people you send this to may send
out 100,000 ormore e-mails and your name will be
on every one of them. Remember though, the more
you send out the more potential customers you will
reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas,
information, materials, and opportunity to become
financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !

=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============

'' My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and
percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
a few days later she jumped in with both feet. I
made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay
the old ''I told you so'' on her when the thing
didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3
weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the
next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00
........ all cash! I was shocked. I have joined
Jody in her ''hobby''. Mitchell Wolf M.D.,
Chicago, Illinois

================================================

'' Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my '' Not being the gambling
type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind
to participate in this plan. But conservative as I
am, I decided that the initial investment was so
little that there was just no way that I wouldn't
get enough orders to at least get my money back''.
'' I was surprised when I found my medium size
post office box crammed with orders. I made
$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing
about this deal is that it does not matter where
people live. There simply isn't a better
investment with a faster return and so big''. Dan
Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada

=================================================

'' I had received this program before. I deleted
it, but later I wondered if I should have given it
a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to
get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-
mailed again by someone else.........11 months
passed then it luckily came again...... I did not
delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my
first try and all the money came within 22
weeks''. Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.

=================================================

'' It really is a great opportunity to make
relatively easy money with little cost to you. I
followed the simple instructions carefully and
within 10 days the money started to come in. My
first month I made $ 20, 560.00 and by the end of
the third month my total cash count was $
362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to the
internet''. Fred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand

Did Chris Foster ever get back to you on this? I had asked him to let you 
know when he found out, but I wanted to make sure the information actually 
got passed along. Let me know when you get a moment.

Chris Foster has requested that we set up a new broker - the Automated Power 
Exchange, in EnPower. It is the same counterparty we already have in EnPower, 
with the same name and contact information. Melissa, I believe you said we 
could pretty easily add the name in the broker list if it was the same as in 
the counterparty list, which Chris has verified it is. Please let me know if 
you need anymore information.

Thanks,
Kate

Longhorns Find Running Game Just in Time
To Maul OSU in Big 12 Opener; OU Next Foe

The Longhorns ran over, around and through the Oklahoma State Cowboys and
their No. 1-rated rushing defense Saturday en route to a 42-7 victory befor=
e
a sellout crowd in Austin.
The Cowboys, while they hadn't played a good rushing team in their first
three games, had allowed only 91 net yards rushing all season and they real=
ly
do have a pretty salty front seven.
Led by sophomore Kenny Hayter's 122 yards, the Longhorns had 205 net yards
rushing. It was the first time Texas has has 100 net rushing yards in a gam=
e
since the 58-7 thumping of Texas Tech last season.
In the six games they played between Texas Tech and Oklahoma State when the=
y
couldn't reach the century mark in rushing, it's no coincidence that they w=
on
just twice.
But they utilized a new gap-blocking technique  to combat the Cowboys'
stunting defense, and it worked to near perfection because Hayter, who was =
a
little used third-team tailback, turned a lot of little holes into big ones
with his hard running.
While the rebirth of the running game was the big overall story, it didn't
happen until the second half and UT had a shaky 10-7 lead at that point.
Texas still might have lost the game without three crucial earlier
developments =01)  a huge passing play, a great defensive stand after still
another special teams goof and a penalty against the Cowboys that wiped out=
 a
potentially game-turning interception.
The huge passing play, of course, was Major Applewhite's 96-yard pass-and-r=
un
connection with sensational freshman WR Roy Williams six minutes deep into
the second half
The Horns were holding a fragile 10-7 lead at the time, they were facing a
third-and-14 and they had already had so many problems with  their punting
team that UT fans everywhere were simply hoping for a miracle first down.
After all, coaches everywhere say the first five minutes of the second half
is the most crucial period in a tight game, and the first five minutes had
been all Oklahoma State. The Longhorns hadn't even made a first down since
the intermission.
But they got a lot more than that. Williams got past the Cowboy cornerback
who was covering him and Applewhite looked left and drew the safety back
toward the middle.
When he finally looked to the right and heaved the ball, the only question
was whether Williams could catch up to it because there are few people in
college football who can catch the fleet freshman.
He did, catching it on his fingertips and racing untouched the rest of the
way. That 96-yard play gave Texas a 17-7 lead and it was all downhill after
that for the Longhorns.
But that play was a gamebreaker only because the Longhorn defense stopped t=
he
Cowboys cold early in the second quarter when a fake punt lost yardage and
put OSU in possession at the UT 38, and because an interception of a Chris
Simms' pass and a long runback inside the UT 10 was negated by a personal
foul penalty against the Cowboys.
The defensive stand came on the series after a blocked UT punt set up OSU's
only touchdown. The Cowboys were leading, 7-3, and the Longhorns, at that
point, hadn't generated enough offense to indicate they could fall farther
behind.
The disallowed interception was a possible 10-point swing because OSU might
have scored with a first-and-goal inside the UT 10. Instead, the Horns kept
the ball and continued a drive that ended in the field goal that opened the
scoring.

Here, briefly, is how the game went:

FIRST QUARTER
Neither team threatened early, but the Horns dodged a bullet on their secon=
d
possession. They started in good field possession, but Simms threw an
interception that was run back inside the UT 10 before a personal foul
against OSU negated the play and gave Texas a first down at the OSU 29. Tex=
as
couldn't move and Stockton kicked a 45-yard field goal to put the Horns
ahead, 3-0, with 7:00 left. OSU TB Reggie White broke loose for 69 yards to
the UT 11 on the Cowboys' next possession, but the UT defense held and the
Cowboys missed a chip-shot field goal try. Applewhite came in at QB for
Texas. UT led, 3-0, at the end of the quarter, but the Longhorns had only o=
ne
first down =01) on the penalty that negated the long interception return =
=01) and
just 30 yards of total offense compared to 100 for OSU.

SECOND QUARTER
The UT defense stopped OSU and forced a punt. With Applewhite still in at
QB, sophomore RB Kenny Hayter got a first down on two tough runs, then seni=
or
TB Hodges Mitchell took a quick pitch around left end for 18 yards. But
Applewhite was sacked and his third-down pass to freshman WR B. J. Johnson
was dropped. That was unfortunate because it forced Stockton to punt, the
snap was high, a defender got loose up the middle and the kick was blocked.
Stockton covered it at the UT 30, and OSU's White scored in two plays,
galloping 21 yard to the 9, then bursting up the middle untouched for the
score to put OSU ahead, 7-3, with  9:59 left. The next UT drive also came u=
p
short, but, facing fourth and 1 at their own 40, the Horns went with a fake
punt. It was a disaster and Stockton was tackled for a two-yard loss. But t=
he
strong UT defense yielded only two yards in three plays and got the ball ba=
ck
for the offense. On his third try, Applewhite got the Longhorns into the en=
d
zone, driving 80 yards in seven plays. Mitchell got the TD on a 3-yard run,
but the big plays were Applewhite's passes of 15 yards to WR Montrell
Flowers, 14 yards on third-and-9 to Johnson and 36 yards to the 3 to
Williams. Stockton's kick gave Texas a 10-7 lead with 4:23 left. OSU got
close enough to try a field goal as time expired, but Ervis Hill blocked it=
.
UT outgained OSU, 140 to 80, in the period.

THIRD QUARTER
A combination of mishaps, including a sack and a half-the-distance penalty,
left the Longhorns facing a third and 14 from their own 4. Visions of anoth=
er
punting adventure were etched into the brains of Longhorns everywhere, but
Applewhite dropped back and found Williams breaking open between double
coverage just past midfield. He heaved it and the swift freshman caught it =
on
his fingertips and raced untouched into the end zone to complete a 96-yard
touchdown play. Stockton's kick put UT ahead, 17-7, with 9:14 left. Lindsay
and White misfired on a handoff two plays later and  UT LB De'Andre Lewis
recovered for Texas at the 13. Hayter powered to the 1 to set up a
first-and-goal. He tried to go over the top, but the Cowboys stopped him,
then the Horns were penalized back to the 6 for a false start. Hayter got
three yards to the 3 off right tackle, but Applewhite's pass on third down
was knocked down and Stockton's 20-yard field goal gave Texas a 20-7 lead
with 6:03 left. Applewhite hit redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis for 21 yard=
s
and another TD with 2:11 left. A two-point conversion try failed, leaving U=
P
on top, 26-7, heading into the final period.

FOURTH QUARTER
With Hayter making good gains and Applewhite hitting key passes, the
Longhorns drove 58 yards to set up a 36-yard Stockton FG and moved 42 yards
for a touchdown, with Applewhite connecting with Flowers for the final 2
yards, Ivan Williams ran 21 yards for the final score with 13 seconds left.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorn offense had its best day of the
season against Oklahoma State, the defense did its usual fine job and the
special teams, with one notable exception, were outstanding.
""After reviewing the film, it's clear that it was the best performance we'v=
e
had offensively,"" he said. ""We scored 42 points and we had no turnovers. Th=
e
offensive line had its best performance.""
""We were pleased with not only the offensive line, but Roy Williams made so=
me
great blocks, too, and Kenny Hayter made some tough runs.""
He also said junior QB Major Applewhite, who underwent off-season knee
surgery, ""played like the Major of old. He made very, very few mistakes.""
The Major of old was very good. He was the Big 12 Offensive Newcomer of the
Year as a redshirt freshman in 1998 and the Co-Offensive Player of the Year
as a sophomore in 1999.
Applewhite and sophomore Chris Simms have been dividing time at QB, and Sim=
ms
started the OSU game, but gave way to Applewhite late in the first quarter.
Applewhite completed 15 of 28 passes for 291 yards and three touchdowns.
Simms, who returned late in the game, completed 3 of 5 passes for 8 yards.
Brown said the defense ""continues to swarm and play really well. Casey
Hampton is amazing and D. D. Lewis had an outstanding day. Quentin Jammer a=
nd
Rod Babers played really well. We had another blocked kick. that's our 12th
in 30 games here. I thought it was Tyrone Jones, but it was Ervis Hill who
blocked the field goal. It's interesting that our two best kick blockers ar=
e
both from Texas City.""
The special teams played well, Brown said, except for having another punt
blocked, and he said that is something that simply has to be fixed.
""The two blocked punts this year have been in different areas,"" he said, ""b=
ut
we have to get it fixed. We can't keep getting punts blocked.""
He said the UT-OU game was such a big game 15 or 20 years ago ""that the
feeling was that the team that won this game had a chance to win the nation=
al
championship."" He said he and OU coach Bob Stoops ""are trying to get back t=
o
that.""
INJURY UPDATE: Brown said SS Lee Jackson suited out against Oklahoma State
and should be ready to play against Oklahoma. He said DT Shaun Rogers
(sprained ankle) is questionable for the OU game. ""We should know more abou=
t
Shaun Tuesday,"" he said. LB O. J. McClintock also missed the OSU game
(bruised knee), but he should be back this week.
BLOCKING, QUARTERBACK NOTES: The big change in the UT running game was
basically one new play - a counter with an off side guard pulling and the
linemen blocking down on the play side. The QB also handed off at least par=
t
of the time on one side and the back veered to the other side for a little
bit of misdirection. . . Major Applewhite's knee has been one of he major (=
no
pun intended) reasons the coaches have tried to use Chris Simms so much in
the early games. Applewhite still isn't 100%, but he's getting closer every
week. In fact, he looked pretty close to 100% Saturday. That's just in time
because the Sooners look pretty potent and the Horns need to have two top
quarterbacks ready to go.

Baseball Recruiting Going Great

The UT  baseball coaches got a commitment last week from right-handed pitch=
er
Donald Lavinski, 6-4, 205, of Class AA state champion Weimar, giving them
pledges from two of the state's big three pitching recruits. They also got =
a
pledge from catcher Curtis Thigpen, 6-0, 175, of Forney.
Round Rock's Joey Guajardo, another right-hander, committed several months
ago. The third member of the big three pitching group is David Purcey, 6-5,
230, a left-hander from Dallas Trinity Christian. He is considering Texas,
A&M and OU.
Purcey was 21-3 at Trinity Christian the last two years and his team won
back-to-back state TAPPS' championships. He also helped his team win a stat=
e
TAPPS' title in basketball last year. He had 123 strikeouts in 75 1/3 innin=
gs
last year.
Lavinski was 14-1 last year with an outstanding 0.70 ERA. His fast ball has
been clocked as high as 93 miles per hour and he is consistently in the 90
mph range. He also has great command of a sinking fast ball and a change up=
.
He struck out 170 batters in 95 innings last year, while issuing about 25
walks and giving up about 40 hits.
He said he also had scholarship offers from Texas A&M, Baylor, Rice, Housto=
n
and Oklahoma State.
Thigpen is an outstanding defensive catcher, but he also wields a potent ba=
t,
bashing opposing pitchers for a .515 batting average last season.
He  also considered Alabama, Baylor and A&M.
Lavinski, Thigpen and Pursey all visited Texas the September 23 weekend,
along with shortstop Michael Holloman, 6-0, 165, of Dallas Jesuit.
Holloman said he is considering Texas and Stanford. He visited Texas earlie=
r
and took his official trip to Stanford last weekend.

Horns Rise in Polls

The Longhorns are No. 11 in this week's Associated Press poll and No. 10 in
the ESPN/USA Today coaches poll. Oklahoma, this week's opponent, is No. 10 =
in
the AP poll and No. 12 in the coaches poll. UT is a 3-point favorite.

Basketball Stars Visit

Kala Bowers, 6-2, of Woodward, Okla., a top national recruit in girls
basketball, took her official visit to Texas last weekend.
She is considering Texas, Colorado, Illinois and Kansas State, and says Tex=
as
and Colorado are her big two.
Heather Schreiber, a versatile 6-2 forward from Windthorst and CoCo Reed, a
5-11 forward from Jersey Village, also came to Austin last weekend. Both
committed to the Longhorns earlier.
Three top juniors also were in Austin on unofficial visits. They are  5-9
point guard Nina Norman of Jersey Village, 5-10 shooting guard Lindsay
Harding of Cypress Fairbanks and 6-1 forward Nichelle Roberts of Spring
Westfield.
Schrieber and Bowers are both rated as top 25 national recruits, and Norman
will be one of the nation's top point guard recruits next season.
Reed and Roberts play on the same high school team and they also play on th=
e
same AAU team, along with Harding.

WASHINGTON, June 5 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The following was released today by the 
White House: 

STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT 

This Administration is committed to free trade as an engine of growth. As 
part of our free trade agenda, we are committed to ensuring that American 
industry and American workers can compete on a level playing field. That is 
why, today, I am announcing my intent to launch an initiative to respond to 
the challenges facing the U.S. steel industry. This initiative will be 
designed to restore market forces to world steel markets and eliminate the 
practices that harm our steel industry and its workers. 

The U.S. steel industry has been affected by a 50-year legacy of foreign 
government intervention in the market and direct financial support of their 
steel industries. The result has been significant excess capacity, 
inefficient production, and a glut of steel on world markets. 

My decision to pursue this initiative comes after extensive consultations by 
Members of the Cabinet with our industry, our steelworkers, and interested 
Members of Congress. We have discussed the challenges facing U.S. steel 
manufacturers, and we understand that we have a critical stake in a healthy 
U.S. steel industry. 

Thus, I intend to take the following steps. First, I am directing the United 
States Trade Representative, in cooperation with the Secretary of Commerce 
and Secretary of the Treasury, to initiate negotiations with our trading 
partners seeking the near-term elimination of inefficient excess capacity in 
the steel industry worldwide, in a manner consistent with applicable U.S.  
laws. 

Second, I am directing the U.S. Trade Representative, together with the 
Secretaries of Commerce and the Treasury, to initiate negotiations on the 
rules that will govern steel trade in the future and eliminate the underlying 
market-distorting subsidies that led to the current conditions in the first 
place. Absent strict disciplines barring government support, direct or 
indirect, for inefficient steel-making capacity, the problems confronting the 
U.S. steel industry and the steel industry worldwide will only recur. 

We see these negotiations and the goal of restoring market forces as being in 
our interest and in the interest of our trading partners and their steel 
industries. That is why we would like to work cooperatively with our trading 
partners in pursuing this initiative. 

Third, I am directing the U.S. Trade Representative to request the initiation 
of an investigation of injury to the United States industry by the 
International Trade Commission under section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974. 
This action is consistent with our WTO obligations. 

This three-part strategy, coupled with further restructuring of the U.S. 
industry, should help the industry meet the challenges it faces. I look 
forward to working together with the industry, the steelworkers, Congress, 
and our international trading partners in support of this important 
initiative.

We sold 20 MW to UAMPS heavy load hours 1/5 - 1/31.  We are using a Glendale 
buy /resale from Mead 230kv to Mona to close the position.  The purchase from 
Glendale is contingent on transmission from IPP to Mona.  If both 345kv lines 
are derated, Glendale will be forced to reduce the delivery at Mona.  We sold 
the energy to UAMPS with the same contingency, so the delivery to UAMPS may 
be reduced as well if you are unable to economically resupply them. 

 Meanwhile, the delivery to Glendale at Mead will become a 'mutually agreed' 
delivery for the next scheduling hour.  If Glendale agrees to the price that 
you want for your power at Mead, the deal should continue to flow.  If they 
will not pay the market price you ask, Glendale may be reduced for the 
duration of the Mona-IPP deration.  When Mona-IPP is restored, the delivery 
to UAMPS is to resume for the next normally scheduled hour, and the Glendale 
buy/resale at Mead/Mona is to resume also.  If you have any questions feel 
free to call."

We face two parallel tracks in the Senate in the coming weeks between now and 
the start of the congressional recess for one week on June 29th.

In the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, we will be facing 
efforts by pro-price caps forces who will use the committee ""bully pulpit"" to 
pressure FERC into more action.  This effort is led by incoming chairman 
Bingaman with support from Majority Leader Daschle.  They are saying they 
will consider acting on the Feinstein-Smith price cap legislation unless FERC 
takes unspecified additional action by the end of this month.

The new track in the Senate will be in the Governmental Affairs Committee 
chaired by Sen. Lieberman (D-CT).  While this committee does not have the 
legislative jurisdiction over energy that the Energy Committee does in terms 
of moving legislation, the Governmental Affairs Committee has  broad 
oversight and investigatory jurisdiction over all federal agencies, including 
FERC.  New chairman Lieberman held his first press conference as chairman 
today and said addressing high energy prices would be a priority.

In that vein, the committee is expected to hold a hearing on June 13 
featuring some of the economists who wrote a letter in favor of price caps 
last month.  We are checking with the Republican staff to make sure that the 
anti-price cap economists (the majority of the discipline, of course) will 
also testify.  We also brief committee members and staff with our arguments 
against price caps and the latest publicly available market data.  On June 20 
the committee will hold a hearing on whether FERC has properly exercised its 
duties under the Federal Power Act to make sure that wholesale power rates 
are just and reasonable.  We are going to meet with the committee majority 
staff, but we presently expect this hearing to have political witnesses 
(i.e., elected officials, possibly including Gov. Davis).

We must keep in mind that Sen. Feinstein had earlier written to Chairman 
Lieberman asking for a hearing on the California energy situation, including 
relationships between FERC and those it regulates (citing the NY Times 
article involving Enron and Chairman Hebert).  There is at present no 
indicationi that either hearing will address this matter.  We are, as you 
might imagine, paying close attention to this situation.

Over in the House, Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzin has said he will write 
to FERC asking them to extend the April 26 price mitigation order to the 
entire west and to extend it to 24/7.  He also asks FERC to see if it can 
implement ""negawatts"" demand reduction administratively.  We are in the 
process of obtaining a copy of the letter, which has not yet been made public.

Also in the House, we expect congressional committees to begin marking up 
portions of the President's energy legislation and related topics as the 
month unfolds. "

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Hi Paul,

Any luck with the draft of the ABB facility agreement form?  Looks like we 
might have some business.

I have forwarded your draft of the turbine document to GE, but have not had 
any comments.  I would like to set up a conference call with GE to discuss 
it.  How is your schedule tomorrow or Monday?

Thanks,

Kay

Yeah, I think I shocked a lot of people, including Kam and others. Well, as shitty as the hours were, I actually liked risk.  I will be working in Risk at my new position at EnergyUSA.  However, a long day for them is 9-10 hours, which is more like a short day at Enron.  I think fewer hours and better pay will make working conditions much better but I am really going to miss a lot of the people that I worked with at Enron.  If was a very fun atmosphere to work in, even during the last few days with all of this merger talk going on.

  Carole told me yesterday afternoon that you left.  I saw you right after lunch with a couple other people looking for a conference room.  I guess I know now what that was about.  That news shocked me because I didn't see itc oming, but at the same time I am not surprised that you left.  With all the uncertainty surrounding this company now plus I know that you had had enough of risk that it doesn't surprise me.
   
  Good luck with the new job and let me know what exactly you will be doing at the new company.

    Hey Jay,

    Just wanted to let you know that I resigned from Enron yesterday and took my job back at Wilkens Weather.   No, just kidding -with Energy USA over in the Galleria area.  They are a smaller, less sexier and more conservative company than Enron but then we all know what can happen to a ""sexy"" company. 

    Anyway, I wish the best of luck to you in your future endeavors.  Keep in touch -you can use this address for now until I know my new address at work.  You never know if one may have to return a favor sometime in the future.  

    See ya,

Talked to Bill McCoy at Morgan, Stanley about the Richard Shelton affidavit.  
He was aware of the efforts made last week, but not directly involved, b/c he 
was out of the country.  Now that he's back, he said he would check into it 
further, but he's doubtful that Morgan will be able to take a public position 
on this.  Although the commodities group is definitely in favor of it, there 
might well be other constituents of the  Morgan Stanley/Dean Witter family of 
companies for whom such a position could be ""too confining"" in other 
circumstances when those other companies/groups might wish to take an 
opposite position.  He said he would look again at trying to get clearance, 
but he's not really hopeful.  He asked me whether Rich Shelton would have to 
actually testify, and I repeated what our counsel told us that 
cross-examination is likely but does not have to occur in Calgary.  He asked 
about our timetable and said he will call me back either way and will try to 
expedite it.  I'll keep you posted.

Regards,
Janice

Per my conversation with Edmund this morning, we are moving the following 
countries to the non-approved list:  Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech 
Republic, Denmark, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, and Slovenia.  Below 
is the list, now updated to reflect this change.

Jurisdictions which are are approved to trade credit derivatives:  Finland, 
Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K, and the U.S..

Jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives include:  
Austria, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, 
Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Scotland, Singapore, 
Slovenia, Spain, and The Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a 
non-approved jurisdiction, it may be possible for them to trade out of a 
branch located in an approved jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches).   
This would have to be determined on a case by case basis.

Please let me know if there are any changes to this list.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : September 26, 2001
Kern River Shippers to See Rate Decrease Oct. 1, More in 2002 
Finally, some good news: a unit of Williams said Tuesday that firm transportation rates will drop by as much as 36.5% for all original shippers on its Kern River natural gas transmission system beginning Monday (Oct. 1). The lower rates will be implemented under Kern River's previously approved extended-term rate program. Williams, which developed a strategy to lower rates in response to customer requests as part of its rate-reduction settlement in 1999, projects more rate reductions next May, when the costs and revenues of the 2002 expansion are reflected in rates. 
""The extended-term rate program was designed to provide long-term, firm shippers with an option to pay lower, more market-responsive rates today in return for extending their contract terms,"" said Kirk Morgan, director of business development. 
Bruce Warner, manager of rates and planning for Tulsa-based Williams, said the company had looked at its ""financial situation and found that if customers could live with longer contracts, we could live with lower rates. The lower rates will be offset by lower depreciation expenses and will not negatively impact Kern River's financial performance."" 
Williams' gas pipeline unit is one of the largest-volume transporters of natural gas in the United States. Its gas pipeline unit's Kern River Gas Transmission, based in Salt Lake City, operates a 922-mile system delivering Rocky Mountain and Canadian natural gas to markets in California, Nevada and Utah.

Kevin:
Sara and I were discussing the additional utility provisions that we 
typically insert into our ISDA MAster Schedule when we are dealing with a 
regulated counterparty.  As a general rule, most of these counterparties 
object to such provisions.  In light of this, we thought that as a compromise 
we would eliminate the Information Sheet, the ""additional reps"" and the 
additional covenants and rely on inserting the following as an Additional 
Termination Event:

""the filing of a motion, pleading, application or other similar action in any 
proceeding or action by Party B, a commission, regulatory agency or other 
entity having jurisdiction over Party B, in respect of Party B, or in respect 
of any other similarly situated entity organized under the laws of the 
state(s) in which Party B is located or regulated to the effect that 
performance under this Agreement or one or more Transactions hereunder or 
similar agreements is unlawful or that this Agreement or one or more 
Transactions hereunder or similar agreements are void or voidable.""


What do you think about this?  Alos, have you had a chance to come up with a 
revised definition for ""Affiliate"" that we could use in our setoff provisions?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Michelle, 

Please review the following wording highligted in red.  Our goal is to be able to automatically deduct any outstanding balances (tax advances, expense advances/loans) from assignees when they terminate.  The collections are usually offset against the vacation payout & severance.  

If EMPLOYEE's assignment by COMPANY, as described in this Assignment Letter, is terminated by COMPANY or by EMPLOYEE, upon such termination, regardless of the reason therefore, all compensation and all benefits to EMPLOYEE under this Assignment Letter shall terminate; and any outstanding balances due COMPANY will be deducted from any remaining payments due EMPLOYEE.  If EMPLOYEE's employment hereunder is terminated by COMPANY, then EMPLOYEE may be eligible for severance payments as set forth and governed by the Enron Corp. Severance Pay Plan (Restated January 1, 1993).  ...

Tim, 

I added the wording to Section VIII of the letter, Item F, Terminations.  Attached is the full text for reference. 

Thanks,

We can probably keep it non-tax specific, i.e., to include items like expense report advances or other loans. 

Should your employment with the Company cease, any outstanding balances due the Company will be deducted from any remaining payments due you.

I propose that we submit the following paragraph into the assignment letters which states that we can deduct any funds owed to Enron for tax settlements from future severance payments:  

""Please note that should your employment with the Company cease and it is determined that you owe a refund to Enron after your tax return is calculated, the Company has the authority to deduct these funds from any future severance payments.""

Please feel free to make any necessary changes.

Gene:

 I appreciated the update on your health status.  It appears you are taking a 
very tough situation and, with help from some of the best doctors in the 
world, setting about to turn it around.  I'm sure it goes without saying that 
you know we are all pulling for you and betting on a positive outcome.

 Clearly your health is the number one issue now.  To the extent you want to 
work and can work, we are delighted to have you back in the office.  But that 
is a very distant secondary concern until you get everything done about your 
health that can be done.  If there is any way I or Enron can be of any 
further help, please let me know.

All of the assignment documents are supposed to be filed in the contract 
file.  Please review the contract file for these assignment effective dates.  
The date something is invoiced has nothing to do with the tariff filings, 
what is important is the delivery period and terms.  imbalance cashouts 
should be reported as such under the transport tariff, not a sales tariff, 
unless the transport does not provide for cash-out in which case a separate 
sales tariff needs to be set up to go with the Sales Contract which should be 
in the contract file.  Do you agree?

		 Subject: Missing Tariff Numbers on HPL Annual Report



Dan:  The following sales contracts were listed on the HPL Annual Report 
without a tariff number.  

Would you review the following information and advise as to whether a sales 
tariff filing is required.  It appears that the transactions related to these 
sales contracts took place prior to the time the contracts were assigned to 
Houston Pipe Line Company.  Let me know if the tariffs we prepared to respond 
to the Auditors query, should truly be included with our November 10th TRRC 
Tariff Filing Report..

Contract #96022611:  H&D Operating Company - Gas Lift Sales:  Delivery period 
01/99 Invoiced 9/10/99; Delivery period 02/99 Invoiced 10/12/99.   HPL needs 
sales tariff for period after assignment.

Contract #96019866:  OXY USA. Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract: Delivery 
period 03/99; Demand Charge Invoiced 3/26/99.  Why shouldn't this be under 
the transport tariff for this transport imbalance.

Contract #96022610: Preferred Pipeline Company - GTC Sale Spot: Delivery 
period 01/99 and 02/99; Invoiced 08/27/99. Who issued the GTC, if HPL, then 
HPL needs to file a sales tariff.

Contract #96019865: Texcol Gas Services Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract 
(Contract was set up per Tommy Yanowski relating to the imbalance on 
Terminated Transport Agreement 12-88974-204  (311a2(284C)Offshore Tx); 
Delivery period 02/99; Invoiced 03/25/99. Cashout under 311transport should 
not require a tariff filing, however, it may require a FERC filing.

Contract #9600821: HPL Resources Company - Master Purchase Sale Firm.
Delivery period 01/99, Invoiced 02/12/99
Delivery period 02/99, Invoiced 03/24/99
Delivery period 04/99, Invoiced 06/10/99; 09/10/99
Accounting Summary Report of Manual Invoices recorded in the G/L for 01/99, 
03/99, 04/99, 05/99, 06/99, 07/99, 09/99, 10/99, 11/99 and  12/99.
Do you know when this contract came back to HPL and should the tariff reflect 
activity that took place prior to when it was assigned to HPL?  This 
information should be in the contract file.  The tariff should not  reflect 
activity prior to the time the contract was assigned to HPL.
 
I will need to get final information to Carla Nguyen by Monday October 30 so 
she can make the appropriate notations to the annual report pages 31a2, 31a3 
and 31a4.

Thanks for all your help!

Gerald,  good to hear from you and very belated congrats on your law
degree/bar exam/ascent to layerhood deal.  That's way cool.  Sounds like you
are really doing well out there.  Tool belts, house restoration, sounds like
fun.  Too bad the Navy won't allow me the time to do it.   Regardless,
they've been moving me around so much lately that it's all pointless.  I got
back from Italy in Feb.  I started school here in Newport, RI.  Next I'l
spend 3 months in Northern VA going to school.  Then, I'll meet my ship in
the Persian Gulf for a fun filled 4 months in the Desert.  I'm getting
pretty down on the Navy and may be considering a job change in the next two
years.  Well, to answer your question, Michele and I have three kids now.
Kelly is four, Carson is three, and Katherine (Kate) is two months (born
4/15/99).  I figure we're done for now but will have to check back when Kate
is too big to cuddle.  Good to hear George and Ernie are still doing well.
Crazy days we had together.  Funny how we all tend to grow up eventually.
My parents are fine.  They are almost finished with the house on the ranch.
When that is done, they plan to move out there permanently.  John is working
semi-part time as a governemnt employee counting fish on alaskan fishing
boats.  Dangerous job/low pay.  But he likes it and he has his summers for
surfing expeditions (i.e.  he is still bumming around).   Mark is the
biggest suprise, he went back to school and got a Masters degree in library
science and information technology.  He did really well and now has a job
with Microsoft working as an archiver (apparently librarians and computer
geeks too now).  Hey good to hear from you.   don't know when/how we can
work in a visit.  Possibly after March next year unless you're out in San
Diego while Im in the Gulf and you can look Michele up.  Keep in touch and
well work something out.  Take care Gerald.  Paul."

Kim -

A couple of thoughts regarding Charles Hinckley's email and your pending trip 
to San Diego:

1.  I have scoured all of United Technologies' filings and even their 
website.  I found exactly ZERO references to CalPeak Power, LLC.  I'm not 
saying that CalPeak ISN'T a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Technologies, 
but I find it strange that I can't find anything on CalPeak in United's 
filings/online info.  

2.  If CalPeak is indeed a subsidiary and WILL guarantee CalPeak's 
obligations, then we are in great shape.  United Technologies is A+ rated, 
with lots of liquidity available in the form of unused lines of credit.

3.  If CalPeak will not benefit from a United Technologies guaranty, then we 
definitely need to see their financials/management notes.

Will they send you the financials/notes before you leave for San Diego?

J. -

What's your take on this?  They want to meet with me on friday in San Diego 
to discuss a potential deal as we were short listed on the RFP to supply gas 
to the Calpeak power plants.  If we can't get credit established and 
contracts in their hands, I don't know if we want to waste our time - or 
money.  Let me know what you think ASAP.

Thanks,

Kim

CalPeak Power, LLC is a project company and is now a wholly owned subisdiary
of Untited Technologies Corporation (NYSE: UTC).  UTC information is
available at www.utc.com, and from the commercial rating services.

It is not invisioned that CalPeak will benifit from an absolute gurantee
from UTC; however, some credit suport mechanism will be built into the
project and into the fuel supply agreements.

Steve,

Attached is a rough draft proposed by Irwin Stelzer  for the Advisory Council 
meeting on April 10-11.  You will note that Gavyn is  on the agenda from 3:15 
- 4:00 p.m.   I spoke with his assistant regarding the possibility of Gavyn 
departing on April 12 and was told that he has another commitment and will 
need to depart the Enron Building by 2:30 p.m. on April 11. 

Also, can you tell me if Prof. Joe Grundfest and Lawrence Kudlow are new 
members of the Advisory Council?  I would like to update our contact list.

Comments, please.

Vanessa

$50,000 is pre-match, so I guess the ultimate goal is $100,000 (Like the poor

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to 
Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this 
weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise 
$50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you 
consider helping him reach his goal?

Montana 's power crisis may be more intense thanCalifornia's 

By JIM ROBBINS
New York Times

BUTTE, Mont. - The last large-scale metal mine is silent in this city that 
sits astride the Rocky Mountains. 
The 170-ton, house-sized ore-hauling trucks, which once rumbled with loads 24 
hours a day, have not fired up their engines since last summer. Nor have the 
conveyors, the crushers, the concentrators and the grinders. And most of the 
320 workers who carved out a living extracting copper, molybdenum and silver 
from the 600-foot deep Continental Pit have scattered to other states and 
other jobs. 
Montana Resources, which owns the mine, has been out of affordable power for 
nine months. At the beginning of 2000, the mine was paying $26 a megawatt 
hour, up from $19 the year before. Last week, however, a megawatt hour cost 
$320. 
While California has grabbed most of the national headlines for a power 
crisis caused by deregulation gone awry - rolling blackouts resumed there 
last week - another power deregulation crisis has been unfolding here in 
Montana . And in some ways, it is far more striking in its impact. While 
Californians may be somewhat protected from skyrocketing costs, Montanans are 
not. Paper companies, mines and other large industrial companies in Montana 
have been laying off workers because they cannot afford to pay their electric 
bills. Residents are expecting their household electric costs to as much as 
double by July 2002. 
A growing number of Montanans want to roll back the clock to a time when 
their state, blessed with its own sources of cheaply produced power, had some 
of the lowest electricity rates in the country. Many residents are directing 
their anger at the Legislature, which in their view deregulated the market 
for electrical power solely at the behest of the Montana Power Co., once the 
state's dominant utility. 
Under deregulation that took effect three years ago, Montana Power sold its 
hydroelectric and coal-fired generating plants to PPL Corp., the Allentown, 
Pa., company that sells power in 42 states and in Canada, Great Britain and 
Latin America. 
Like other owners of power generation sites, PPL has been profiting immensely 
under deregulation by charging rates based on the forces of supply and 
demand. Montana Power still distributes electric power around the state, but 
soon will be getting out of that business as well. 
The change has left large power consumers such as Montana Resources 
scrambling to survive. They have scoured the region for affordable 
alternatives. They have asked PPL to make at least some cheaper electricity 
available but it is unclear if that will happen. And they have lobbied the 
Legislature to reregulate electrical power. 
""We've got to play all of our cards,"" said Greg Stricker, president of 
Montana Resources, as he gazed over the company's open mining pit and a giant 
statue of the Virgin Mary that sits high on a mountain above it. ""We're faced 
with extinction."" PPL, however, says it has no choice but to sell its power 
at market prices. 
On a national scale, the plight of Montana , which has less than a million 
people, is not as visible as that of California, which has 34 million. But 
Montana 's experience shows what can happen when power prices spiral out of 
control and businesses and consumers are not protected. 
Montana 's power crisis is rooted in the history of the Montana Power Co. It 
was formed in 1912 by Anaconda Copper Mining to ensure power for Anaconda's 
extensive mining, milling and sawmill operations. Montana Power built 
hydroelectric dams on 11 rivers across the state, dams that still create 
power at low cost. 
Anaconda also was accustomed to getting its own way. The company owned most 
of the state's daily newspapers until 1959 and wielded tremendous influence 
among elected officials. Anaconda, the historian Bernard DeVoto wrote, 
""maintained a more thorough-going ownership of Montana 's wealth, government 
and inhabitants than any other corporation has ever been able to maintain in 
any other state."" 
The Anaconda era ended in 1977 when the company was bought by Atlantic 
Richfield, the oil company that has since been acquired by BP. Arco closed 
the mines in 1980 and the smelter in 1983. Montana Power, which had become 
the state's regulated utility, outlived its creator. 
By the mid-1990s, however, Montana Power was worrying about its own future. 
Power deregulation, a national trend, looked inevitable, and the company's 
big industrial customers already were shopping for sources of cheaper 
electricity . 
So, trying to make a virtue of necessity, Montana Power began the process of 
getting out of the power business. It diversified, creating an Internet 
service provider called Touch America. It also began to push for power 
deregulation, saying it would result in lower costs and more customer 
choices. The company was hoping that deregulation would make itself 
attractive to investors and potential buyers. 
A deregulation bill, the Electric Utility Restructuring and Customer Choice 
Act, was introduced in March 1997, when the legislative session was nearly 
over. Lawmakers, most of them farmers and ranchers and businessmen, approved 
it hastily. 
To some critics of deregulation, the passage smacked of the era when Anaconda 
dictated what the Legislature should do. Few Montana lawmakers understood 
what was happening, said Ken Toole, a Democratic state senator and an 
opponent of the deregulation. ""It was a steamroller with the mantra of free 
market,"" Toole said. ""Debate took place in a compressed period of time and it 
was not brought before the public."" 
Montana Power disputed that interpretation. Jack Haffey, its president and 
chief operating officer, said, ""it was not a bill pulled out of somebody's 
pocket and foisted on the public."" 
Still, Montana Power emerged with marketable power plants and its thriving 
Touch America business. The company sold its power plants to PPL, investing 
much of the proceeds in Touch America. Montana Power's shares, adjusted for 
an August 1999 split, soared to nearly $65 in March 2000 from less than $20 
before deregulation. (The shares have since returned to a below-$20 range, 
closing on Friday at $16.48) Company insiders cashed in their stock options 
at the peak and some became rich. 
And, for a while at least, deregulation appeared to be working. Competition 
among power suppliers was pushing down the price of electricity . In January 
1999, Montana Resources' power costs fell to $19 a megawatt hour from the 
regulated price of $30. 
But starting in June 2000, Stricker said, ""the market started to go nuts."" 
Rising demand, coupled with a lack of new supply, pushed up prices sharply. A 
megawatt hour spiked as high as $680 and then settled back into the 
$200-to-$400 range. 
The region's power crisis has been aggravated recently by a drought that has 
reduced the amount of hydroelectric power generated. Steve Walsh, a Montana 
Resources spokesman, said the company's suppliers told it that rates could 
reach $1,000 a megawatt hour in the third quarter. 
Montana 's labor force, meanwhile, has suffered. Since last summer, according 
to the Montana affiliate of the AFL-CIO, more than 1,000 workers have lost 
their jobs in layoffs caused by power price inflation."

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you
made from selling Enron stock before the company declared
bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and
REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their
retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in
California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron
and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California
consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of
Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company
declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.
And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California
energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of
consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the
largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of
Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to
keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to
help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's
underhanded dealin

Eric,
 
Thanks for the news on our friends.  It sounds like everyone's getting along pretty well, all things considered.  I saw Enron on NBC Nightly News last night.  Tom Brokaw had a long special on the Congressional inquiry, and they had some footage of people leaving the building.  I also saw a shot of the trading floor on CNN yesterday from last year.  I saw Dick Jenkins, but couldn't see if there was anyone else I knew.  It's amusing to see how the media reports so many half-truths and misleading information.  
 
I got a call from Hector the other day but haven't had a chance to talk to him.  He recently got a job with the Clinton group in NYC, so he's pretty excited about that.  That's great that your brother's wedding is coming up.  Tell him congratulations for me.  Are you the best man?
 
Hope the bidding turns out well.  Happy surfing in the meantime!
 
Brian

Thanks for the explanation b/c I was completely clueless.  They are 
definitely censoring.   She hasn't answered anything other than the program 
requirements, etc.  What a waste of time.  But I guarantee you they'll bring 
this up as something great they've done to improve communication.

Fifth grade assignment

The teacher gave her fifth grade class an assignment: 
Get their parents to tell them a story with a moral at 
the end of it. The next day the kids came back and one 
by one began to tell their stories.  

Kathy said, ""My father's a farmer and we have a lot of 
egg-laying hens.  One time we were taking our eggs to 
market in a basket on the front seat of the pickup when 
we hit a bump in the road and all the eggs went flying 
and broke and made a mess.""  ""And what's the moral of 
the story?"" Asked the teacher.  ""Don't put all your eggs 
in one basket!""  ""Very good,"" said the teacher.  

""Now, Lucy?""  

""Our family are farmers too.  But we raise chickens for 
the meat market.  We had a dozen eggs one time, but when 
they hatched we only got ten live chicks. And the moral 
to this story is, don't count your chickens until they're 
hatched.""  ""That was a fine story Lucy.""

""Johnny do you have a story to share?""  

""Yes, ma'am, my daddy told me this story about my uncle Bob.  
Uncle Bob was a pilot in Vietnam and his plane got hit.  He 
had to bail out over enemy territory and all he had was a 
bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and a machete. He drank the 
whiskey on the way down so it wouldn't break and then he 
landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops.  He killed 
seventy of them with the machine gun until he ran out of 
bullets, then he killed twenty more with the machete till the 
blade broke and then he killed the last ten with his bare hands.""
""Good heavens,"" said the horrified teacher, ""What kind of moral 
did your daddy tell you from that horrible story?""

""Don't fuck with Uncle Bob when he's been drinking.""

Stinson,

I add the total P/L due to contract rollover.  When the number of trades is 
large
and the spread is not too small, the model prints a lot of money, dominated by
those trade earning the half of BO spread. 

I also wrote an explaination about the model on the front page. I think we 
are 
ready to deliever the model V.1.

The next step is to incorporate the intra-day market movement by using high 
and low
prices into the pricing.  I will call you on Monday.

Happy Thanksgivings !

Zimin

I wanted to reply, even though I have called recently.  Work has slowed down 
a little bit, but will probably pick up in a week or two.  I have traded 
calls with Kara the past two days, so I haven't talked to her in some time.  
Anyway, I hope your figuring out where we should go for a trip this sping.  
We will have to know whether Megan and I need to work on our golf games or 
not.  We have been thinking maybe you guys are thinking about going to 
Ireland or England to play some of the old courses of this world.  Or maybe 
you have been thinking about going to Paris to visit the city of love.   
Anyway, these are just some of the thinks we have been thinking about.  Talk 
to you soon.
Love 
Ben"

Effective immediately,   we need to make every effort to avoid buying Malin 
P/X energy,   bouncing   this energy off of a NW control area  and sending 
back in the ISO to cover our load in NP.   We now have the ability to adjust 
bid an SC purchase in NP with the PX.   This allows us to adjust bid to our 
load in NP15,  effectively limiting our expense risk to cover load

Leaf Harasin has created a procedure for this process.     Jesse Bryson has 
been working on this project as well.

It is important to note that we are experiencing some difficulty with the P/X 
as they are not entirely comfortable with this process yet.
Additionally,  we are having some internal software difficulty managing this 
new feature.    See David Poston or call Pete Davis for support,  as usual.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
On  preliminary review of the Draft Proposal,  I wonder whether, if adopted by the Chargeback Complainants and the Participants Committee, it should be submitted to the Commission in the Chargeback Docket, not in Judge Birchman's proceeding under the July 25 Order.  That order limits Judge Birchman to making findings of fact and certifying the record on ""(1) the mitigated price in each hour of the refund period; (2) the amount of refunds owed by each supplier according to the prescribed methodology; and (3) the amount currently owed to each supplier (with separate quantities due from each entity by the ISO, the investor owned utilities, and the State of California."" (Mimeo at 42).  If the settlement were submitted in the Chargeback docket, the Commission could refer it to Birchman with appropriate instructions as to how he should treat it when he certifies the record and his findings.  Or FERC could hold the settlement until after Birchman's report.

This brings up timing questions.  The July 25 Order directed the ALJ to certify the record and findings 45 days after receiving the CAISO's hour-by-hour reconstruction of mitigated prices between October 2, 2000 and June 20 2001.  Under Judge Birchman's Order of August 14 establishing a trial schedule (attached), final ISO data won't be submitted until September 17, which pushes the certification and finding date to November 2.   We need to think about how the schedule shown in the attached order impacts the timing and method of bringing the settlement before FERC, assuming that the proposal's  wording and substance are accepted by all Chargeback Complainants and the Official Committee.

Hosts Disclaimer:  A good many people have been congratulating me on my 
creativity with this page, so I feel I must make it clear that I did not 
create the page, I am merely hosting it.  I originally received this as an 
email, but because many of my friends use email programs that cannot handle 
images, I decided to put it on a web page.  I do not know who originally 
created this page, but my congratulations go out to whoever did! 

Enjoy the page! 




RESIGNATION

I am hereby officially tendering 
my resignation as an adult. I  have 
decided I would like to accept the 
responsibilities of an 8  year-old [IMAGE]again. 

I want to go to McDonald's and think 
that it's a four star  restaurant. [IMAGE]

I want to sail sticks across a fresh mud 
puddle and make a  sidewalk with rocks. 

I want to think M&Ms[IMAGE]are better than 
money because you can eat  them. 

I want to lie under a big oak tree and 
run a lemonade stand  with my friends on 
a hot [IMAGE]summer's day. 

I want to return to a time when life was 
simple; When all you  knew were colors,  
multiplication tables, and nursery  
rhymes,[IMAGE]but that didn't bother you, 
because you didn't know what you  
didn't know and you didn't care. 

All you knew was to be happy [IMAGE]because you were blissfully unaware of 
all the  things that should make you 
worried or upset. 

I want to think the world is fair. 
That everyone is honest and  good. 

I want to believe that anything is 
possible. I want to be  oblivious 
to the complexities of life and be 
overly excited by the  little things [IMAGE]
again. 

I want to live simple again. I 
don't want my day to consist of  
computer crashes,[IMAGE]mountains of paperwork, 
depressing news, how to survive  more days 
in the month than there is money in the 
bank, doctor  bills,[IMAGE]gossip, illness, 
and loss of loved  ones. 

I want to believe in the power of 
smiles,[IMAGE]hugs, a kind word, truth, 
justice, peace, dreams, the  imagination, 
mankind, and making angels[IMAGE]in the snow. 

So . . . here's my checkbook 
and my car-keys, my credit card  bills 
and my 401K statements. I am officially

Vince,
 
I have  left a voice mail to you and will wait to talk to you personally. My brother  Vikas, who is now in London, is trying to make a switch from consulting world to  working for a specific firm. Over last few months, I have heard of great deal  about the success of Enron on line business which fits well in the area of his  expertise. I am wondering if you know of some one in London who he can speak to  regarding career opportunities. 
 
Since  I spoke to you last, a number of things have changed. Recently, my manadate was  broaden to include leading a charge for developing a risk management function  for both the domestic and international businesses for GMAC. Needless to say,  this is exciting albeit making the life a little more hectic than  usual.
 
Talk  to you later.

Jeff,

That is good news about Leander.  

Now for the stage.  I would like to get it sold by the end of March.   I have 
about $225K invested in the stagecoach, 
 it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven.  

I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee 
and Jaques Craig can 
work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a 
second lien.  I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%.
Checkout this spreadsheet.





These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes.   
However,  I am very concerned about the way it is being shown.  Having Lucy 
show it is not a good idea.  I need you to meet the buyers and take some 
trips over to get more familar with the property.  My dad doesn't have the 
time and I don't trust 
Lucy or Wade to show it correctly.  I would prefer for you to show it from 
now on.  

I will have the operating statements complete through December by this 
Friday. 


Phillip

Per my conversation with Eloise Williams the proceeds of $138,475,829 were never recorded on 33R but were recorded on 33Q.  Since this is a sale of inventory I'm assuming that the gain will be ordinary and should be reduced by the tax basis in the credits of $104.8 million.

Mary, I'm not sure what accounting is doing.  The entry below is not complete.  For third quarter close company 33R received proceeds of $138,475,829 for SO2 credits.  The credits are held in inventory on company 33Q, the mark-to-market revenue for the SO2 is reported on 33R.

The attached workbook is my best guess of the tax basis in the credits ($104.8 million); the tax gain should be about $33.7 million.

Can you check with your accounting contacts for company 33R to get a complete picture of the accounting entries?

Sara, Susan:

The attached revision of the Appendix to the HS Resources to HS Energy 
Services assignment corrects the Total MMBtu column, which had a math error.  
The trade descriptions, which would control in any event, have not changed.

We would like to proceed with execution on Thursday.   Would you please 
accept the changes  in the red-lined documents I sent yesterday, print 
cleans, get signatures, and fax to me at 303-296-9709?  I will send the HS 
signiture pages in the morning, and will send the J. Aron pages as soon as I 
get them.

I will be in touch with you in the morning to discuss further.

Thanks. Jim

Subject: havmann - lpg claim with underwriters


john,

sorry it has taken so long to reply to the copy of the fax from clyde & co 
which you passed to me some time ago.

basically, i reviewed the paper from sgs on copper corrosion contamination in 
lpg which reviewed possible scenarios of the lpg becoming off spec during a 
sea voyage. their conclusion was that propane which contained polysulphides 
could meet the copper corrosion tests at loading but then decompose during 
the long voyage to turn the propane off spec for copper corrosion. this 
position would support what clyde & co are saying as a factor against enron's 
case. 

the whole contamination problem, while possibly an inherent vice, was an 
unknown inherent vice. nobody was aware of this problem at the time of 
loadings but rather the problem came to light once some of the first ships 
reached their discharge ports. the sgs report also brings into account other 
reasons for the copper corrosion failure such as:

a) unclean cargo tanks, containing sulfur from previous cargoes,
b) mixing of two grades of lpg, both initially on spec,
c) the use of unclean inert gas, and
d) other incompatible corrosive cargoes (such as ammonia) by improper 
cleaning procedures.

i did take the liberty to call chris clucas of dorchester maritime's 
technical department whom i met when dorchester was managing the enron owned 
ships. it was chris who initially sent me the sgs paper as an update to the 
gastech 1988 paper.

it may be a good thing i did call him as he mentioned a subsequent paper 
issued by sgs in about 1998, by g.vermeiren, where sgs went to saudi to check 
their procedures during the time of these off spec cargo loadings. it appears 
the paper's conclusion is that unknowingly saudi may have put some pacifiers 
into the propane which would have caused the copper corrosion to show as on 
spec. therefore, the product could have actually been off spec before it was 
loaded but, due to the pacifiers, tested as on spec.

in summary, i would agree with clyde & co that this should be settled, 
especially with the amount being discussed. i do not know where this claim 
stands and again apologize for the delayed reply.

regards

Jeff,

Unfortunately, we have to keep the date as scheduled.  I am very sorry.  
Hopefully, the next meeting will work better for your schedule and we will 
have a better opportunity to give our preferences for dates.  This time 
round, tax sort of took the lead.  Also, I promise to provide a summary 
afterwards.

Hope you have a great weekend.

Good idea.  Unfortunately, I'll be sitting in an office in S.D. with Sempra 
execs.  My apologies.  But since this is likely to be ongoing, preference 
would be to participate in the ""first"" meeting.

Jeff,

Could you possibly call in? We could arrange for a dial-in number in that 
case.  I know that we arranged that date with tax bc/Sue is coming in that 
day and they had cleared that date with some of the accounting or legal folks 
already.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

I would very much like to attend but have a meeting scheduled that day with 
Chris Calger (ENA) and the CEO and CFO of Sempra Energy (we're trying to do a

3rd, or Nov. 7-9.  Hope it's possible to re-arrange

Hi,
We're going to press on the forced ranking story. I  have a couple more 
questions for you. If you can have answers to me by in the  morning, June 8, 
I'd appreciate it...
?
thanks, Michelle
?
?
What does the room look like in one of these peer  review committee sessions. 
Are the PRC's around a conference table, if so what  kind, cherry wood, 
mahogany, etc. What's on the wall in these rooms?.? Are  there charts, etc?? 
Are the rankings on paper or on the wall? Does everyone  have a copy of the 
rankings?and employee's paper work (ie the feedback  responses, etc.)
?
?
How many employees does one PRC rep represent  generally?
?
Tell me about some of the perks that Enron offers  its employees, ie 
childcare, daycare, daycamp etc. On the day that I was there,  what was that 
barbeque outing all about. Was that something that was company  sponsored? If 
so, how often do you sponsor it?
?
Tell me about some of the awards the company has  received. (ie best 
workplace, etc.)
?
These answers don't have to be long. Just give me  the basics...

Going forward, I suggest the following.

Procedure for Storage Confirmation and Execution:

1.  Storage contracts mailed to trader.
2.  Trader forwards contract to short-term transport book
3.  Transport book verifies deal terms, sends a copy to back office, gets approriate signature on original, mail original to counterparty, contact counterparty to inform them that contract is executed and mailed back.
4.  Back office verifies terms, add contract to a binder, send copy to confirmation group.  
5.  Confirmation group verifies terms, add contract to their files, send a copy to Global group to scan contract in the system in order to view contract on-line via Information Management System"

Fred,

Dale Rasmussen has been handling the breakout contracts for the LV CoGen 
project, and I think the form is in good shape. However, the breakout 
contract is for all the LV Co Gen units, but that is easy enough to fix. Does 
GE know this is coming?

What are you projecting for a closing date?

 We need the unit numbers (original and serial), associated delivery dates, 
price attributable to the units (maximum liability amount), price to sell the 
LLC member interests, and the contact persons from Panda for the contract.  
Will there be a development fee, and if so, how much?

If you get me the particulars of the deal we can work on it in house.  We 
have the forms, so we can get cracking without outside counsel.  In fact, 
I've been working on the form letter agreement today in connection with the 
other deal.  Retaining outside counsel requires internal approval, which I'm 
sure we can get in the next day or two, assuming no conflict of interest. I 
can get started on the process if you are ready.

If you think these guys are serious, we can set up the LLC's.  We may want 
two LLC's if the total price is in excess of $50mm.  Kathleen, please talk to 
me before we do this as I think we should discuss the slate of officers.

Kay

I talked with Ben this afternoon and understand that we are ready to proceed 
with Panda Energy in a transaction involving the sale of member interests in 
special purpose entities associated with the four(4) LV units.  I have left a 
message with Panda letting them know that we are prepared to proceed and will 
begin preparing a set of draft definitive agreements for their review.  I 
have asked Panda to confirm that they are ready to receive these documents 
and proceed.  I understand that you are in Houston.  Please call/see me 
tomorrow morning so that we can discuss this transaction.

Kay:  We need to prepare a draft set of definitive agreements for this 
transaction.  Can Carolyn complete this while you are in New York?  Also, 
what is the status of the LM Breakout contract for the 4 LV units.  Let me 
know.

Kathleen:  We need to confirm tomorrow morning that we have received executed 
CA's from Panda.  I have the CA execution originals for the four Panda 
entities at my desk for Ben's signature.  These need to be received prior to 
sending Panda the definitive agreements.  We will fax signature pages to Ben 
tomorrow.

Chris:  See me tomorrow morning to discuss the technical spec's that were 
sent to Panda

I will be at my desk by 8 am tomorrow morning.

I know that SCE is taking this position.  They are simple wrong.  Unless and until we get all of our ""positive"" CTC back from the Utility, why should I even begin to consider their ""goofy"" arguments.  In addition, SCE is receiving $3.3 B which is a full payment of all Negative CTC.  If their issue is to have a Undercollection charge against all customers, that's a different policy matter.  The CPUC agreed to the idea of Negative CTC and SCE needs to pay.  

Also, if we are 5% of load and the Undercollection is $3.3 B, I think that SCE would be looking for $165 MM - our entire claim.  They aren't talking about 5% from our view $150 MM claim.

Need to think about it a bit.  Here's some of what we know based on the settlement:

Total debt = 6.35 B
After they contribute all cash on their books and agree to eat a little, the PUC is allowing them to collect somewhere between $3.0-3.3B--depends on who you talk to.
The total owed to ESPs is $243 MM.

Jeff,

Do we know how much Edison's total under collection is?  Would it be as simple as to determine their total (around $3 billion?) and  gross receivable (before any payments - 145 million) and calculate the % (around 5%)?  This would result in a pretty small percentage.  Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis.  If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st,   this % (5.7%)  would also be very small.  How do you think they will look at it?  I think we would all agree to a 5% haircut, if they would JUST PAY US!

Wanda:  I faxed the examples that Edison faxed us and that you and Michael and I talked about some time back.  I'm sure that's how Edison would calculate it.  Does it make sense to run the numbers and see what our ""contribution"" to Edison's undercollection would be under Edison's view?  If you need another copy, let me know.  Question:  I don't know what our book looks like on this issue, but if we were to take the ""netting"" through a reduction in the PX credit going forward, how much of a hit would that be, particularly if we were to get the $120 MM up front?

Best,

Subject:	Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff"

Mike Swerzbin did not get a confirm from the broker on these deals. They were 
two sleeves done with EES, and Driscoll just entered them. Thanks for the 
heads up. Any other questions, just give me a call or e-mail.

Vince:

Per Susan's email below, do you want to go to the luncheon for John
Hennessey?  She doesn't say where the lunch is going to be, did you
get an invite?

The only thing you have that day is 9:00 AM Larry Thorne and the
Energy Derivatives Class at 11:30.

Let me know.

Thanks!

Shirley

Hi Shirley,

thanks for corresponding with Carol during my absence, and confirming our
meeting with Vince Kaminski at 1:30 on May 4th.  I have a question about
the logistics.  I believe Dr. Kaminski has received an invitation to an
event in Houston: new Stanford president John Hennessy is visiting a number
of cities on a ""welcome tour,"" and it just so happens he is hosting a
luncheon in Houston on May 4th.  If Dr. Kaminski wants to attend the
Hennessy Welcome Tour luncheon, Donna Lawrence and I could meet with him at
1:30 somewhere in the hotel.  If he's not attending the presidential event,
please let me know where you are located, and we'll plan travel time
accordingly.

Regards,
Susan

The attached memo is to be distributed to all US-based employees this afternoon.  We've opted to include the various changes to HR policies and employee programs in one consolidated memo to reduce the number of negative e-mails employees receive over the next few weeks.  Please review at your earliest convenience and provide changes to me.  If  I do not receive changes from you by 3:30 p.m. today, I will assume you have none.

Hi all!
Attached is a breif outline on the NJ Basic Generation Service Standard Offer. - Please read.
Although this will have risks regarding capacity, ancillary services, and basis; This may be an excellent means to test the PJM standard offer market, since the minimum size required would be a 100MW slice.
The NJ Board of Public Utiltiy is currently shaping the auction process, and our regulatory people have been involved by interventions.  Jeff Ader (EES) has been working with regulatory to push that this should be a retail deal (similar to the retail customers that New Power won from PECO) and not a wholesale deal.  Is this the message we want to send? I suggested to regulatory that we propose that it should be split as to allow the best pricing for the NJ utilities and for everyone to be able to participate.  They suggested that if EES has more interest than EWS (apparently they wish to take 1000MW of this), that we should push the retail.  How would retail take the ancillary and capacity risk?  Are we set up such that EES would have a better chance of winning this?  What is our interest in taking on these exposures?

Can we meet later today, or tomorrow (Friday) to determine at least, how we want regulatory to proceed with the BPU.  Nick, Palmer and I had a conference call with regulatory yesterday, and want to get back to them as they will be filing with the BPU very shortly.

Daren,

The above meter recorded a flow on Jan 15 this year.  It has not had any 
activity all the way back through 1999.  I checked with Cheryl Jones and the 
flow is good.  It was apparently turned on for that one day.  Do we need to 
put in a deal for this flow?  

Thanks.

Also, we had a transport nom from Texaco into King Ranch, so we will have 
adequate flow into Stratton."

Jim, if we delete current Section 4.3, then we would like to reinsert the 
""negligence"" clauses in Section 4.2 (I don't remember how they got negotiated 
out in the first place).  So it would read:

4.2  a.  TW shall release, protect, indemnify, defend and hold harmless EPFS, 
its affiliated companies and officers, directors, employees, and agents and 
servants, contractors and subcontractors (""Indemnified Party"" or ""Indemnified 
Parties"") from and against that portion of the liabilities, losses, claims, 
damages, penalties, causes of action, suits (including suits for personal 
injuries or death or property damage and including reasonable attorneys' fees 
and expenses) caused or contributed to by the negligence of TW or its 
agent(s) arising out of or in connection with its obligations under the terms 
of this Agreement.

b.  EPFS shall release, protect, indemnify, defend and hold harmless TW and 
its Indemnified Parties from and against that portion of the liabilities, 
losses, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action, suits (including suits 
for personal injuries or death or property damage and including reasonable 
attorneys' fees and expenses) caused or contributed to by the negligence of 
EPFS or its agent(s) arising out of or in connection with its obligations 
under the terms of this Agreement.

c.  [same as current version]

Susan-
See what you think of using the following in Section 4.2 and deleting
Section 4.3 in its entirety and replacing it with the below:

Section 4.2
  a.  TW shall release, protect, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless EPFS,
its affiliated companies and officers, directors, employees, agents and
servants, contractors and subcontractors (""Indemnified Party"" or
""Indemnified Parties"") from and against any and all liabilities, claims,
damages, penalties, causes of action, suits (including suits for personal
injuries or death or property damage and including reasonable attorney's
fees and expenses) in any way directly or indirectly arising out of or in
connection with TW's performance of its obligations under the terms of this
Agreement.
  b.   EPFS shall release, protect, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless TW
and its Indemnified from and against any and all liabilities, claims,
damages, penalties, causes of action, suits (including suits for personal
injuries or death or property damage and including reasonable attorney's
fees and expenses) in any way directly or indirectly arising out of or in
connection with TW's performance of its obligations under the terms of this
Agreement.

Section 4.3
In no event shall either party be responsible for the gross negligence or
wilfull misconduct of the other party or their Indemnified Parties.

Subject: Updated floor plans



Attached are the revised floor plans with data that has been presented through today.  Tina Rode has submitted the churns for the groups that fall under Duran.  Doug Gilbert-Smith and Harry Arora have okay'd their people/locations.  DSM is complete.

There are only a few outstanding issues.  Power Services has been allocated 7 desks, however the names have not been placed; my understanding is the remainder of the team are located with the regions.  

I have not heard anything from Fletch, Dana Davis, or Suarez.  Don Black and Rogers have not emailed their changes, but LaDonna is working on it and said she'll put in as many churns as possible in this evening.  

Feel free to call me on Sunday if needed.

Dear Steve:

As per your voicemail message, I have asked the HRGIS team to provide the necessary information so we can send an email message, regarding certification, to those employees at the Vice President level and above, and those employees who have not certified compliance to date.

Please see the draft message prepared for your review and comments:  

	""As you know, Enron has adopted certain policies, with the approval of the Enron Board of Directors, all of which are set forth in Enron's Code of Ethics.  In order to ensure our continuing compliance, please carefully read the policies and re-submit your statement of personal agreement by ___________________________(date).  

Use your SAP id or GIS id (global employees only) and certify your compliance at http://hrglobal.enron.com.  In addition, please be sure to include any exceptions to your certification.

The Code of Ethics is available for your review on the Enron Home Page at http://home.enron.com.

If you need assistance, please contact the Integrated Solution Center Help Desk at 713-345-4727.

Thanks for your continuing compliance.""

Please let me know when you are ready to proceed with this email.

Thanks.

of this memo?  Should we prepare a separate ""Action Plan"" or strategy to 
submit to Mike?  You may recall in our meeting of Friday last that Mike 
committed to assess the long term situation in BA (at least I think that's 
what he agreed to do) and we (foolishly) committed to prepare a review of our 
activity in BA.  Maybe we can discuss on Friday morning at 9 am (Houston)/12 
pm (BA).  Let us know if you have any questions.  I believe that Lynn is in a

UT Gets Heralded Point Guard; Horn FB Team Battling Bruises

T. J. Ford, the 5-11, 165-pound point guard who was recruited by schools
all
over the country, picked Texas Wednesday, saying he wants to play
basketball
for coach Rick Barnes and the Longhorns.
Ford, who led Fort Bend Willowridge to a 36-1 season and the state Class 5A
Championship last year,  probably is the most heralded basketball recruit
in
Longhorn history. He is rated as one of the nation's top 25 players and is
one of the top two or three point guards.
He had offers from schools all over the nation, but wound up deciding
between
Texas, Louisville, Memphis State and Houston.
I saw Ford at the State Basketball Tournament last year. He is as quick as
any player I have seen. He can run faster dribbling the ball than anyone I
have seen at the high school level. He can dunk the ball easily, too. He
averaged 9.1 points, 9.3 assists, 5-1, rebounds and 4.8 steals for
Willowridge last season.
He is great at everything except shooting, and that won't bother Barnes,
who
likes point guards who are more interested in distributing the ball than in
their shooting opportunities. Distributing the ball is what Ford does as
well
as any point guard in the country.
He had a press conference Wednesday  to announce his decision to play
basketball for the Longhorns.
""I'm excited to have a chance to play for coach Barnes and the Longhorns,""
he
said. ""I just felt like Texas was the best place for me. I have a great
relationship with coach Barnes and the other Texas coaches and I'm looking
forward to it.""
But first, Ford said he hopes he can help Willowridge win another state
title. ""We have four guys back who started last year,"" he said. The team
lost
6-8 center Ivan McFarlin, who signed with Oklahoma State, but Ford said the
Eagles have another good inside player to replace him.
The Longhorns have only two scholarships to award this year and Chris
Wright,
a  6-10 center at Redwater, committed last year.  So, unless some
underclassman leaves the team, Ford's commitment wraps up recruiting. Both
Ford and Wright plan to sign on Nov. 8, the first day of the early signing
period.
* * * *
The Longhorns finally got in a full-scale practice Wednesday after being
driven indoors by lightning Tuesday..
Coach Mack Brown said he and the other coaches have stressed to the team
this
week the importance of playing good games back to back.
""We've proved we can play well after a loss,"" he said. ""We need to prove we
can play well after a win. We've been a team that never knows who's going
to
show up, and we need to start showing up every week.""
Brown said he told the players they can beat everybody left on the schedule
or lose to everybody left on the schedule, depending on how hard they work
and how hard they play.
He said injuries are a problem, particularly at defensive tackle. ""Casey
Hampton is the only one who is healthy,"" he said. ""Shaun Rogers will play,
but his ankle is still sore. Ryan Haywood has a sore shoulder and Stevie
Lee
is still out with his foot injury.""
He said he still hopes to redshirt Adam Doiron, but said, ""We might have to
play him this week. We're really thin at defensive tackle. Doiron is a true
freshman from Duncan, Okla.
* * * *
The Longhorns are a 21-point favorite over Missouri.
* * * *
QB Chris Simms said Tuesday he might redshirt next season, but said he has
no
plans to transfer after losing the starting job to Major Applewhite. Simms
played last year as a true freshman and he could have two years left after
Applewhite graduates if he redshirts next season. If  he redshirts, current
freshman QB Chance Mock would back up Applewhite.

FOOTBALL RECRUITING  NOTES: With 19 early commitments, the Longhorns
probably
will sign six to eight more prospects. They can take at least 26 players
because punter Brian Bradford of Trinity Valley JC will enroll in January
and
can be counted against last year's class total. . . TE James Moses and DE
Jonathan Jackson, the two Galena Park North Shore stars the Horns are
recruiting, say they plan to come to the Missouri game this weekend.

Notice No. 01-365
October 30, 2001


TO:
All Exchange Members / Member Firms
All Clearing Members

FROM:
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:
EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING




EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING

The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., last
night
approved a series of measures to offer credit intermediation through
clearing services and trading tools for the over-the-counter (OTC) natural
gas market.

This plan will include the introduction of exchange of futures for swap
(EFS) transactions and large order execution to the natural gas futures
market within the next few weeks, along with the previously announced
electronic trading of cleared natural gas swaps and basis contracts.

Recent events in the natural gas market have served to reinforce the
necessity of counterparty credit risk management and have accelerated the
Exchange's plans to introduce a full array of risk management tools under
the umbrella of our clearinghouse.  Combining these trading vehicles with
our Henry Hub futures contract will offer market participants the
advantages
of these instruments in conjunction with one of the most liquid commodity
markets in the world and provide greater stability to the market as a
whole.

The Exchange is in a unique leadership position to offer these services
with
natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reaching the equivalent of
approximately 230 trillion cubic feet and the notional value of last year's
transactions Exchange-wide totaling $3 trillion, or $14 billion per day.
One half billion dollars is available to participants on each of the
Exchange divisions through each guarantee fund and the respective clearing
members.

EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical
(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the
execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures
transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The
transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market
quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities
and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the
underlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to
liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two
parties involved in the transaction.

The clearing member representing each party will be responsible to notify
the Exchange of the amount and type of futures contracts involved, the
price
at which the futures transaction should be cleared, and the identity of the
parties involved.

The Exchange will also begin permitting traders to execute block trades of
250 natural gas futures contracts or more in the first two nearby months at
the best bid or offer for that size.  These trades will not be permitted
during the closing range.

Early next year, the Exchange will introduce a cleared Henry Hub natural
gas
swaps contract, providing the marketplace with direct clearing on the most
popular energy swaps contract over the last several year.  As part of this
move, the Exchange will clear OTC-executed transactions through its EFS
mechanism.

I have little that Steve does not probably know by heart.  But a few comments 
to Steve's point on siting new power plants.  I ASSUME ""SENATE ENERGY 
COMMITTEE"" IS THE FEDERAL SENATE, NOT THE STATE SENATE.  I HAVE GEARED MY 
SUGGESTIONS TO THINGS THE FEDS CAN OR SHOULD DO.:

THE PREAMBLE: The continuing lack of leadership by the Governor is causing 
serious concern for anyone looking for a stable environment in which to make 
the $billions in investments required for new power plants.  The desparate 
search for blame placing (of exactly the guys that would make the 
investment), the lawsuits, the simplistic, outright misrepresentations of 
what happened and is happening, the threats of condemnation, etc. are doing a 
good job of making the public very uneasy and effectively destroying the 
""market"" that resulted in the largest initiation of investment in power 
plants in the state's history.  To the point, the debt lenders are getting 
nervous; the equity providors are getting nervous.  (Duke:  ""I would have 
less third world risk developing a plant in Brazil..."")  If the final result 
of all of this is a public power agency that basically controls the grid and 
the buying and selling of power, the cynic might observe that we will have 
traded the accusations of greed of the present environment for a reversion to 
the old environment of inefficiency and escalating rate bases.  In my 
opinion, there is no way that the governor's present political initiatives 
will result in the number of power plants that are necessary to cover the 
demand.  He may be covering the near term price/supply issues with his CDWR 
initiative (I note that it is winter time and power demand is down, 
notwithstanding stage 3 alerts - wait until summer peak demands...), but 
destroyed the desire of the long term risk takers to develop new plants in 
this market.  If the politicians think the ""state"" can do the development, I 
don't think so.  Think about it:  there just is not anyone in the IOUs or 
CDWR or the Munis or any state agency that can make the decisions necessary 
to make the investments required IN A TIMELY MANNER.    The public entities 
do not even have the staffs to do the required work, much less the political 
environment to get anything done, given the continued thirst for ""doing 
things right"" vs ""doing the right thing.""  Maybe we will get back to long 
term power purchase agreements for the development of new power plants.  I 
point out that the Standard Offer contracts developed by the ""State"" and 
entered into 15 - 20 YEARS AGO in a regulated environment by nearly 10,000 MW 
of QFs are STILL OUT OF THE MONEY.  (Per SCE, since the PX began in 4/98, 
only during August and December of last year were they in the money.  We 
checked it out - they are right.  That is astounding.  And we want to go back 
to that??)  Enron would be pleased to participate in long term PPAs, 
especially since we are developing several sites, and can make money doing 
that.  But if we want to be statesmen about this, we need must get a market 
paradigm back.

THE SUGGESTIONS :

1. Federal Environmental issues:  There are 4 agencies in CA that get 
involved in air issues:  US EPA, CEC, CARB, and the local AQMD.  Lot's of 
rhetoric that each is just doing its own job, but the de facto result of that 
many agencies looking at the inevitably overlapping issues is that the 
requirements end up much tougher than they need to be.  Letting the state 
deal with the last 3, and focusing on the US EPA because of where Steve will 
be testifying, seems like the US EPA (probably through a change in law at the 
Federal level) could do the following:

 a. Take a leadership position in rationalizing the rat warren of districts 
and basins and ERC creation and transfer restrictions.  To our utter 
amazement, every little district that we have gone into to develop power 
plants have completely different rules and have required a completely 
different approach re ERCs- SF Bay Area, South Coast, San Joaquin County, 
Kern County, Placer, etc.  ERCs are the single biggest problem we have in 
moving forward on the development of over 2000 MW of new plants we have on 
the books.  I point out the ERC market in the east for SOX.  SOX ERCs 
produced in Ohio can  be used in a new plant in Indiana.  This is not 
technically crisp, but was a rational, political decision as part of the 
Clean Air Act.  We need that same rationalization now in California.  
Granted, CA and its politics was probably the genesis of the arbitrariness of 
AQMD vs county boundaries vs basin boundaries, but if we can get the state to 
the table to change this, the EPA will be involved.  Leadership by all is 
necessary.  When 2.5 ppm new plants are being held up, the 100 ppm plants 
will continue to be used to produce the power.  Do the math and tell me if 
the pollution produced during the period of delay is worth the result.  Do it 
again realizing that many of these 2.5 ppm plants will never be developed, 
given the difficulty. 

 b. Consider impact fees:  the concept of ""pay to pollute.""  In LA, there are 
car pool requirements to reduce pollution.  If a company cannot or will not 
carpool sufficiently, they can pay a fine that the district applies (I think) 
to general programs, like electric water heaters vs gas, electric lawn mowers 
vs gasoline, mass transit, etc.  Implement a similar program for power 
plants. Work in concert with the local air district and the EPA to develop a 
program that allows the developer to pay the market price for credits (FYI:  
+$20 million for Pastoria) which the district uses to develop credits from 
existing sources that have not yet been cleaned up  (see list 4 lines above, 
and others.)  Necessity:  power plant proceeds while credits are being 
develop.  If it takes 10 years to develop the credits, consider issues and 
value of fact that the 2.5 ppm plant will eventually replace the 100 ppm 
plants.

 c. Stop the crusade for ever lower BACT requirements that are based on vague 
representations, inconclusive data and over zealous developer agreements.  
Example:  Several years ago, Goalline Technologies developed SCONOX for NOX 
reduction in a 25 MW unit in LA.  Good thing to do, but based primarily on 
the results of that small unit and the salesmanship of Goalline's president, 
we got ratcheted down on our 500 MW plant in Pittsburg to 2.5 ppm.  SCAQMD 
calls to SCR vendors indicated ""we can do that"".  EPA jumped on board.  
Guarantees from EPC contractors with LDs for nonperformance are different 
than ""we can do that"" from an equipment supplier.  Now, EPA and others are 
wanting 2 ppm, again based on vague data.  Sam even advises requests to 
consider ~1 ppm.   (I point out that there are ZERO frame 7Fa units in 
operation at these levels in California.)  GE has told us ""absolutely not"" to 
a 2ppm guarantee.  However, I believe that requirements will in fact be 
reduced again by EPA, just because they can.  Again, do the math on delaying 
or stopping the development of, say, a 2.5 ppm plant (because EPA wants 2 
ppm) in favor of the continued operation of a 100 ppm plant.  Hugely more 
resultant pollution.

 d. Be open minded and proactive with developers' novel methods of creating 
new sources of ERCs.  PG&E had a heck of a time creating ERCs for their Otay 
Mesa 500 MW power plant in San Diego, ending up putting new engines in 4 
harbor boats and +100 garbage trucks.  Enron has several similarly dificult 
initiatives underway (Steve cannot tell anyone this, FYI only:  we are 
looking at replacing engines in harbor boats in SF Bay, replacing engines in 
""yard"" locomotives in Sacramento and LA, replacing agricultural pumping 
engines in the Central Valley, putting SCR technology in cement plants all 
over CA.)  We could take years to get these programs approved as did PG&E, or 
we can take several months, with EPAs (and others) leadership.

2. Federal Siting Issues:  California is at least attempting through 
legislation to speed up the siting on new power plants.  Unfortunately, the 
Federal agencies do not have the time line requirements to provide their 
review on the speeded up schedules.  For example, a request of the Fish and 
Wildlife Department for a review/permit gets put on the priority pile, first 
come first serve:  shopping centers, housing developments, power plants, 
power lines, etc.  I understand that our Pastoria project had 65 F&W 
applications ahead of it when we applied.  And, there was no limitation on 
how long they could take to get the review done.  I understand that one power 
project has waited 2 years for its review.  The only way we got our permit 
was Sam Wehn begged F&W to figure a way to get it done ahead of the 65 other 
applications.  Fortunately, F&W figured that we could reapply under an EPA 
rule in this specific case, which did have a timeline limitation.  We should 
not have to rely on luck to get plants permitted.  Suggestion:  require the 
federal agencies involved in power plant or transmission line permitting to 
speed up their review/permitting times to be consistent with the state 
initiatives to speed things up.  

3. Market Issues:  I will not go into this in detail, as Steve is more able 
than I to vocalize these issues.  However, from a power plant development 
point of view, if we want the private sector to develop MERCHANT power 
plants, and I believe we do because of the enormity of the investment 
required, we must get back to a market structure.  As I am sure Steve 
remembers, one of the big issues we all dealt with in ""deregulation"" was 
stranded cost.  We can avoid those issues by getting the private sector to 
make the investments.  Steve knows all the issues:  stability, liquidity, 
credit worthy counterparties, lots of counterparties, etc.

Steve Kean will be testifying at the Senate Energy Committee's hearing on 
Wednesday regarding California.  Steve and Jim Steffes asked me to contact 
you for the following information.  I've listed specific requests for several 
people, but am copying many more of you for your input as well.  Anything you 
can provide by sometime on Monday will be appreciated!

Dave Parquet - Siting of new power plants in California.  Any insight you can 
provide regarding the rules, the current climate, what would fix the current 
situation, etc.

Richard Sanders - Steve thinks he might be asked about whether the market was 
manipulated.  Please provide information on whether this was the case and who 
the participants likely were.  What's the current climate regarding 
sanctions, etc.?

Mary Schoen - Any information you can provide relating to air emission issues 
in California, and specific details for our recommendations regarding air 
emissions.

Steve Walton - The status on RTO West, Desert Star, Cal ISO and general 
information on RO development.   

Sue Mara - Specific ordering language requiring the utilities to buy only 
from the PX.  Was it required through legislation or the CPUC, and what 
exactly does it mean.  Who was involved in formulating the language?  
Information on block forward markets.

Alan Comnes - A copy of the CDWR response and anything they might have 
available regarding long term proposals from the government.

Dan Allegretti - We have the e-mail Jim sent regarding the UI deal.  Please 
provide more specifics on the deal, and information regarding portfolio 
management approach.

Thanks for your help!

Due to an outlook error, some of you may have not received this message.  I am resending to ensure that the entire committee receives a copy.  Sorry for any inconvenience.

As requested at the 11 October PRC Committee, attached is a comprehensive overview of the proposed PRC process (360  feedback, PRC and bonus compensation) for year-end 2001,  by Business Unit and Function.  We look forward to comments, amendments or concurrence. 

In addition, as regards employment agreement provisions with target bonus amounts based on performance, we have included the bonus language contained in the majority of such agreements.  

Should you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact me,

Gina Corteselli

Sara - 

Can you please help Jane in putting credit language into the confirmation of 
a Japanese deal?  I have provided a worksheet with credit provisions that 
would normally go into a master or an omnibus confirmation.  In this case, it 
will be an omnibus.

Please let me know if I can do anything from here.

Hi John,

Thanks for this, just wondering though, how do you usually get from this sort 
of table to the actual provisions to include in the contract.  Alan, Mark, is 
there any easy way to do this?

Thanks.

		 Subject: credit for Nippon Chemi-con

Morten Erik - 

I recommend the credit terms provided in the attached document to be included 
in the Nippon Chemi-con contract.  These are industry standard terms for a 
counterparty with credentials such as Nippon-Chemi-con, and these industry 
standards are what will enable Enron to syndicate the credit risk if we 
decide to do so in the future.  

After my discussion with Jonathan last week, I think it is clear that Credit 
is on the same page with your team in that we recognize the importance of 
getting this first deal booked.  I think that in proposing the terms of your 
transaction to the counterparty though, Enron can begin educating the market 
as to the nature of the credit risk imbedded in the deal structure, and in 
doing so, begin setting the same standards we have in our other portfolios.  
The attached credit terms are not set in stone, but I think they are a good 
place to start.  I will make myself available to you and the counterparty to 
discuss the credit terms, and we will be very willing to negotiate the terms 
in good faith.  

My point is simply that we should not enter into any of these transactions 
without fully discussing the credit implications with the counterparty.
 
Please feel free to call me or write if you have any questions or concerns.

John

Sorry for my delayed response.  A postal vehicle would get the same credits as a Ranger EV would get.  That is:

2001 - 9.12
2002 - 9.12
2003 - 2.85

Bill, any delays on this project are NOT from the env. matrix.  I received 
the matrix from the team sometime last week (tuesday -thursday) when I was 
out of town on business.  When I came back on friday, I completed the matrix 
and sent it back to the team.  Any delays on this issue are from the team, 
not from me.  As I remember the project, it involved work on the right of way 
and therefore was covered by the blankets we have for SHPO and F&W.  There 
were no project delays in terms of permits or approvals......

Subject:  Mewborne - Quercho Bone Springs Unit - Sec 23-18S-32E

Wade - As you're probably aware of by now, on April 2nd, Carl Eby with
Phillips called inquiring about a possible tie-in of the subject unit to
our ""Young Deep"" pipeline system we acquired from Koch.  A question arose
as to whether or not a west to east spur existed off the north/south
mainline which would be near the unit.  It was initially conveyed to me
that ETS would take a backhoe out to the mainline to make this
determination.  I have since learned that this has been delayed due to the
need for an ""environmental matrix"", whatever that may be.  The roads to
this unit are in extremely poor condition, and the operator would like to
pipeline connect if possible.  Production is represented at 300 bpd.

A couple of issues:

1)  Could someone explain to me the process involved in an ""env. matrix"",
and why it take 2 months to determine if we have a pipeline in the ground?
Is someone with ETS in Houston delaying this, if so, who is the responsible
party?
2)  Tariff on this system (NMSCC #17) is 50 cents/bbl at this time, plus
PLA.  From the maps I have, it appears this system consists of around 10 to
12 miles of gathering and mainline.  Current production on the system is
around 115 bpd of WTI, or $23,000/yr monetized.  The pipe in the ground is
fairly new from what I've been told by my contact at Koch.  If we can
manage to tie this well in, revenue would be raised an additional
$60,000/year at current tariff rates.  What costs are currently associated
with this system?  A decision needs to be made on the economic feasibility
of keeping it operable given the current tariff rates and current/proposed
throughput, or the rates needed to keep the system viable.

Bottom line, Phillips and the producer need an answer, one way or the
other, so they can get on with the business of safely transporting this
crude oil.  EOTT Pipeline needs an answer, one way or the other, so we can
decide how to best manage this system.

Any assistance in moving this forward and allowing EOTT to maintain some
image of credibility would be appreciated.  I would also like to pass along
my appreciation of Rick Cribbs and the information he has been able to
provide thusfar.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.  

Enron Freight Markets
During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.

EnronOnline
On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.

Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. 

EnronOnline Statistics

Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001

?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million
?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion
 

IN THE NEWS
Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

You mentioned that it sometimes takes a while for the shiftwork differential

Thanks for the resume.  I have been out of town the last several business 
days, so I am just now catching up on e:mails.  David told me that he ran 
into you at lunch.  Small world...

How are things going for you?  I hope that this was a good move for you.

With the change in segmentation rules on Transco, it has become much more 
critical to know the primary receipt and delivery points for the capacity we 
are buying.  Mr. Goodell said that Tennessee's EBB will indicate if the 
points on the capacity you are buying are secondary or primary.  I would 
prefer to know the actual primary points on the contract, especially the 
delivery points.

I just bought some Z6-Z6 capacity from Penn Fuel for the balance of the 
month.  Steve Gillespie verified that Penn Fuel released the primary receipt 
and delivery point on the contract.  But, I'm taking Penn Fuel's word for it 
and I am unable to verify the information myself.  It could have a big impact 
on what we flow in Z6.

Colleen, can we do anything about this through the regulatory process?  Let 
me know if you need specific capacity examples."

Mark,

David Portz, Elizabeth Sager and I were looking at this slide and we're not 
so sure it's correct.  We think it should reflect two huge power price 
spikes, the recent ones of this year, and the big one of last year.  We don't 
think the attached slide correctly reflects the two price spikes.  Can you 
take a look at it and get back to me...thanks for your help!

Just a followup to our phone call earlier this morning.   Have begun to see short-term intraday topping patterns.   Natural has reached its mid-range of price objectives.  See no rationale  for holding significant length here.  Winter months seem especially high  and most vulnerable to correction.  The first hour's negative close  produced a sell signal against today's high.  Still too early to ascertain  if this is the end of entire up move.  Have targets into early next week,  but mkt. has reached where it needed to."

Hi Rosalee:
Attached is a summary of the proposal that ENA filed today in response to the 
RFP for power and gas issued by California's DWR.  Also attached is a copy of 
the complete proposal.  Steve Kean asked that I forward it along to you.  
Could you please print out a copy and forward it along to Ken Lay prior to 
his departure for Washington D.C.?  Thanks very much.

All the best,
Jeff

Here is the ""Form B"" that every employee signs.  I am not sure how helpful 
this will be, but I wanted to make sure that whatever we ask the Enron 
employees to sign is consistent, or at least not in conflict with, what they 
have already signed.

Thanks - Gregg

Jim,

Greg received a faxed copy of a slide on ENA - Wholesale Power Network from 
Kathyn Corbally.  The slide gives a comparison in physical power volumes with 
1st Quarter 99 vs. 1st Quarter 2000.  The slides shows a 5% percent increase 
and Greg thought that you mentioned that the increase was closer to 20%.

Please advise.

Doesn't change the order, but indicates potential issues on the 2003 Expansion.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
Breaking News : posted Oct 25, 11:12 AM
Breathitt 'Uneasy' About Approach to Pipe Certification 
Although FERC and California regulators have made a lot of headway in past months in their effort to relieve the imbalance between in-state and interstate pipeline capacity, Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Wednesday that she still is somewhat unsettled by FERC's tendency to routinely approve interstate pipe projects without giving full weight to the impact on existing shippers. 
""I remain uneasy about the...policies the Commission has advanced in favor of certification of interstate capacity despite the [inadequacy] of takeaway capacity and particularly the confidence with which the Commission has rejected the legitimate concerns of shippers on [Kern River's] system,"" she said during the regular FERC meeting. 
Breathitt's remarks were part of a concurring opinion on two orders in which FERC denied rehearing of its certificate approval for Kern River Gas Transmission's 2002 Expansion Project and California Action Project [CP01-31, CP01-106-001]. Firm customers of Kern River sought reconsideration of the certificate orders on the grounds that the expansions would result in pro-rata capacity reductions for existing shippers at Wheeler Ridge and would diminish their firm delivery rights. 
Despite her concerns, Breathitt noted that she was ""pleased that over the past six months the Commission has come to acknowledge that our actions in certificating the Kern River expansions could exacerbate the problems of delivering natural gas to end-users in Southern California."" 
Even more importantly, ""the Commission has recognized the potential degradation of shippers' firm rights resulting from the certification of additional interstate capacity is an appropriate factor in the public benefits analysis that we use to determine whether a project is in the public convenience and necessity,"" she said. 
Moreover, ""I am relieved that certain events are occurring in California that will mitigate congestion at Wheeler Ridge. More takeaway capacity is on the horizon, and the California PUC is considering certain regulatory relief that will facilitate the transportation of natural gas from Wheeler Ridge to Southern California markets."" 
Nevertheless, Breathitt urged her FERC colleagues ""not [to] lose sight of the panoply of issues we must consider in issuing natural gas pipeline certificates."" 
This doesn't mean, however, that she is against all new pipelines and expansion projects, Breathitt said. ""I most certainly share the sense of urgency to ensure adequate and reliable energy supplies. However, there is more to the Commission's mandate under the Natural Gas Act than simply getting more pipe in the ground."" 
Breathitt noted that the Commission plans to revisit the issue of the adequacy of California takeaway capacity when it takes up Kern River's pending application for its proposed 2003 Expansion Project [CP01-422]. Firm customers on the pipeline have already protested the application. They claim that Kern River has sold nearly 500,000 Dth/d of additional primary firm delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge in the three expansion projects, and that they are experiencing scheduling cuts as a result. 
When the Kern River 2003 expansion comes before the Commission, ""I will continue to advocate a thoughtful and coordinated approach to fostering badly needed interstate and intrastate expansion in California.""

Subject:	FERC Draft Orders on Kern River and PG&E Projects

FERC today issued Draft Orders denying rehearing in the following:

Kern River, CP01-31 (2002 Expansion Project)
Rejected arguments of the Firm Customers that the project should not have been approved or, alternatively, the rights of the expansion shippers at Wheeler Ridge should be subordinate to those of the existing shippers.

PG&E Gas Transmission, NW, CP01-141 (2001 Expansion)
Rejected Newport Northwest LLC's assertion that requiring the expansion shippers to pay a fuel cost surcharge to recover any incremental fuel costs due to the additional compression approved for this project is contrary to FERC precedent and the policy statement on expansion facilities.

These orders should be issued within the next few days, and we will circulate copies.  Let Melinda know if you want to see the draft copies before then (they are not available electronically)."

Hi Carol -
Sorry for the delay.  The ""credit person"" at Inland is probably Julie Beck,
although she can naturally be overruled by the Temple-Inland Treasurer, Dave
Turpin, or CFO Randy Levy, since Temple-Inland will be obtaining the letter
of credit and will serve as guarantor.  Since they are at least one step
removed from the process, if you could tell me what questions/comments from
my 5/16 memo they will need to address, and ideally your
responses/commentary in some summary format, I can upstream this information
to them, obtain their feedback, and speak on their behalf.
Thanx,
Jack Falconi

Thanks for thinking of sending this to me as I always appreciate any California regulatory data.  This report came out in May and is known as the CEC's ""White Paper"" on the CA Natural Gas Infrastructure.  After Com. Woods appointment at FERC, the CEC made sure he was aware of their paper and forwarded it to FERC.  The primary thrust of the paper is in line with our position that SoCal and PG&E need to expand their take-away capacity at the border.  Interestingly the FERC issued a similar finding after the Technical Conference on the same subject was held in Wash. DC.
I don't expect the CEC to do much of anything with the paper beyond the press they got for identifying one of the causes for the price spike and a shortage of gas into the state.  Let me know if you have any other questions.  gh

Glen,

This is very interesting reading.  Please read this (sorry, it's kind of long) and let me know if it meshes with what you think is happening in California.

Kim,
Thanks again to you and Lorraine for a wonderful time at lunch yesterday. I
hope we can do it on a much more regular basis. Here is the web site with
the CEC report I was referring to yesterday. I think this is a useful
reference; the FERC is giving it some serious thought as well.

Dictated letter from Ken Lay

Dear John:

I enjoyed your recent e-mail.  I also appreciate your kind comments 
concerning our broadband activity.  The deal with Blockbuster has been a 
great deal of fun and is opening up all kinds of additional opportunities.

I enjoyed looking through the agenda for your meeting in Sweden.  It looks 
quite informative and interesting.  Sweden is also an excellent place for a 
summer conference.

The young man you refer to in your letter should send his resume to Celeste 
Roberts at (713) 853-0555.  If he would also copy me on the letter to 
Celeste, I would be happy to follow up and make sure it is carefully 
considered.

I'm delighted that your life appears to be going very well at the current 
time.  I hope our paths will again cross in Aspen or elsewhere in the not too 
distant future.

Warm regards,

Ken"

Jim: 

Celina Ozorio is a paralegal in the Rio office who has performed very well 
this past year and who we would like recommend for promotion to a junior 
attorney (Attorney I) position.  I have discussed this with both Randy and 
Rob and they support this move.  

Celina is a Brazilian-qualified lawyer with a U.S. LLM who was hired a year 
ago as a paralegal rather than as an attorney due to her relative lack of law 
firm experience.  During the past year she has been enthusiastic in pursuing 
her professional development and demonstrating her capabilites as a 
professional.  She has actively sought out opportunities to take on more 
responsibility and to learn more about our business and has worked very hard 
to win the confidence of the lawyers and clients with whom she works.  We 
believe that she has demonstrated the ability to operate at the junior 
attorney level now and the potential to develop into a solid senior Enron 
attorney in the future.  As a junior attorney, she would continue to work 
under the supervision of more senior attorneys and would have the opportunity 
to continue her professional development.  

I understand that we have done this elsewhere in the Company and believe that 
it sends the right message to others in the department that there are 
opportunities for advancement and that hard work and merit are rewarded.

Please let me know how you feel about this recommendation and whether you 
think it would be appropriate for us to schedule her to visit with you in 
Houston.  Thanks.

Regards,
 John

ROCKETS GUARD TO SHARE BACKCOURT WITH BRYANT 

  <http://origin.nba.com/media/allstar2002/francis_drive_020125.jpg>Jan. 26 - Houston Rockets guard Steve Francis today was named as a starter for the Western Conference in the 2002 NBA All-Star Game to be played in Philadelphia on February 10. 

Francis will join Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant in the backcourt along with Tim Duncan of the Spurs, L.A.'s Shaquille O'Neal and Kevin Garnett of the Timberwolves in the Western Conference frontcourt.

The Rockets point guard, who will be making his inaugural All-Star appearance, held the second position among Western Conference guards when the first returns of the 2002 All-Star balloting were announced last month. He maintained that position throughout the process, easily outdistancing Seattle's Gary Payton for the starting nod.

Subject: Cypress Exploration Program - Operator/Cash Call Issue


	

Rick:  I wanted to inform you about a situation where a Commercial Team has 
subjected Enron to some material risk that did not get appropriate 
approval.               

 Here's the story:   On October 30, I received a funding request for my 
approval of approximately $260,000 representing a cash advance request on  
the Bernard No. 1 well, a 16,500 exploratory well in the Cypress Program.   
The request appeared pretty routine but as is our procedure, I had Don 
Rollins check it out .   Don discovered that we had already paid our cash 
call and this cash call represented our working interest partner, Kelley 
Oil's share, which is a highly unusual situation.  Checking further we 
discovered that  the well is being drilled under a farmout agreement from 
Kelley, who wanted to be operator.  Our guys (Thompson/Josey) wanted Enron 
(not Kelley)  to operate the well during the drilling phase but did not want 
to be official operator of record so they set up Rozel Onshore, our prospect 
generator in Lafayette to be our surrogate operator.  Kelley was upset about 
this and would not sign the Joint Venture Agreement unless the cash call 
provisons were deleted.  Thompson/Josey and team agreed and signed the 
agreement which has no initials from the Legal Department.   The effect of 
this was that Rozel/Enron would have to incur all the costs then bill and 
collect from Kelley.

Rick, as you are aware, the cash call provision in a JOA is the primary 
credit risk mitigant that an operator has to ensure that his partners pay 
their share of well costs before costs are incurred.  This can be 
particularly good protection if a well gets in trouble with lots of cost 
overruns that partners don't  want to pay.  In this case, our surrogate 
operator, Rozel has no established credit with oil service companys and no 
money of his own so all services including the drilling rig are having to be 
prepaid by Enron 100%.  The well is heavily front end loaded with costs with 
a total drill and complete exposure of over $4.0 million (if thing go ok!)

I discussed this with Dave Gorte and Brad Larson and we all agreed  that we 
are forced to fund since the well is drilling and failure to fund would shut 
down operations.   Also, keep in mind that this will be an ongoing obligation 
(and risk exposure) during this entire drilling phase.

Lessons Learned:
   1) The E&P merchant finance team has no business operating a deep S. 
Louisiana exploratory test.
   2)  Important provisions, like ""cash call"" should never be given away 
without appropriate risk assessment and approval.

Please call if you have questions.

Cindy,

I had rather in mind targeting the same audiences to which Mr. Mehta spoke,
not a general  press release. I agree that a general message to the world 
would 
attract attention.

Vince, 

You are a saint for lending me a copy of your book.  I agree with you that we 
don't want increase there revenues even by a $1.00, although my 
recommendation (and Mark Palmer's as well) is that we should pursue a 
rebuttal for the following reasons:

As I mentioned I scoured  the internet (Britannica.com, Amazon.com, yahoo.com 
and Dow Jones) and could not find one mention of the book, therefore Mr. 
Mehta's distribution must not be wide at all.  Consequently, his comments may 
not have reached a large audience.  Issuing a rebuttal, may in fact, draw 
more attention to the comments and issues then they are currently receiving.
I believe we should proceed with caution, and respond accordingly (with 
counter comments) only when comments are solicited from us.  So far, we have 
not received any telephone inquiries from media in relation to Mr. Mehta's 
Enron bashing.  May be we should 'leave the stones unturned'.

Let me know what you think.  Also, please contact me when it is convenient 
for me to borrow the book from you.

Regards,

Cindy

Cindy,

I got a copy of the book and another one is on the way from our officer in 
India.
I can lend you the book and you can makes copies of the most important 
chapters.
I don't think we should be buying too many copies and increasing the sales of 
the book.

In general, I think that we should counter the presentations made by Mr. 
Mehta. The person in charge of
our Dhabol operation is a Stanford graduate and maybe he could obtain an 
invitation
to speak at the same forum  and present the facts as they are. He should be 
here for the management 
conference.

Good afternoon Vince,

Christie Patrick mentioned to me the conference that your wife recently 
attended at Stanford.  At this coference Abahy Mehta discussed his/her 
recently published book 'Power Play' - that certainly does NOT flatter 
Enron.  I have conducted a search on Amazon.com, Britannica.com and Dow Jones 
and I am coming up empty handed.  Would you be kind enough to briefly trouble 
your wife to provide any other information she may remember, so I can narrow 
my search.

I greatly appreciate it.

Prentice told me last night that you were very busy, so I took care of
making the reservation on Alaska Airlines and paying for the fare.  When you
get a chance, just send me the $545 minus my share of the rental car we
picked up at Burbank and anything else we might owe.  When are we going out
for a practice round?

 Desk Managers,

I wanted to follow-up from the staff meeting this week on the item to get a representative from each of the desks, who will be the designated tester in addition to Richard.   Please respond with that person name.

Matt,

It would be helpful to all us to know when you will need these resources so we can manage the workload.  

Regards,

Tammy

All:

We're currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed.  Going foward, I would like Bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers/schedulers.  We had this approach with Nomlogic and having Clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely.  Who ever you choose, we would need about 15% of their time for now.  Later on, with coordination efforts and testing, it may go up to 75%.  I don't see that happening for a while though.

 Richard,

 Some time ago, you and I recommended to John Nowland, and he agreed, that we 
didn't have a case against the ship or the supplier of this product (""Elang 
Crude, fit for export""), but that we would try for a quick settlement with 
the cargo underwriter.  Attached is a draft of the proposed letter to the 
cargo underwriters.  David Best, Matt Lee, and I have reviewed and approved 
it and recommend it to you.  The red-lining will of course be cleaned up.  It 
will either be signed by Jim Studdert of our insurance group, or sent by him 
with a transmittal letter signed by him.

 Please let me know whether the letter is acceptable to you.  Thanks.

 Britt

I attach the draft hereto and apologise for the delay.

Mike, I want to see the final costs before determining.  My understanding is 
that there is still significant expenses outstanding.

Subject: Peaker Fee

EE&CC has forwarded the peaker fee ($9.1 MM) invoice to ENA (see at bottom).  
I have sent a return e-mail to Gavin Gaul and John Normand explaining that 
final approval of this invoice will be from you.  Amy and I are waiting for a 
better breakdown of overhead charges on acceleration change orders.  Once we 
have the overhead issue framed out, I would then battle the fee, especially 
on Wilton Center, on a packaged basis with the overhead charges.

As per the Wilton Center fee, I reviewed all of the e-mail rhetoric regarding 
who is to blame for the massive construction cost overruns.  EECC/NEPCO's 
cupbability lies in their insistance from day one that Wilton Center could 
and would be built non-union.  It was only after ENA forced the decision in 
late June 1999 to build the job union (to avoid air permit intervention) that 
EECC/NEPCO even began to deal with how to build the job in a union 
environment.  Even at that point, EECC/NEPCO would not move off of building 
the job on a cost reimbursable basis and did not properly consider other 
alternatives such as fixed unit pricing (fixed price per unit quantity 
installed).  EECC/NEPCO claimed that they did not have enough time to 
negotiate with the unionsor pursue other options.  However, because of their 
insistance to go non-union, they precluded the ability to negotiate until the 
decision to go union was made.  According to our labor experts, breaking off 
union site negotiations and building non-union is worse than just going 
non-union from the start.  In any event, if you need more detail on this 
subject prior to discussing the fee with Larry Izzo, please let me know and I 
will summarize the key points.

I will continue to work with Amy Spoede to tie down the remaining cost and 
overhead issues.  If you need me to do anything else, please let me know.

Regards,


Mike Miller

The above web site offers some good advice in the form of a list of items
to have ready in the event of a major earthquake here in Portland.
 Drinking water, flashlights, and first aid kits are some of the bare
necessities.
I can tell you from experience that if or when an earthquake hits you will
be glad you took the time to  prepare some of these items.

b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=

Based on discussions with Bill, there are deferred taxes already recorded on the books for the difference between the book basis and the tax basis in the common units, sub units and APIs.  Therefore, there is no punitive tax expense created in the 3rd quarter by executing the 140 transaction.  The book tax calculations will be just the effective tax rate (approximately 37%) multiplied by the pre-tax book gain.  Accordingly, the tax expense will not result in a non-recurring loss on the sale.  The net gain will be approximately $6 million prior to the effects of the EGM MTM income.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Here is the latest......
Senator Burton spoke with the Speaker last night and urged him not to convene 
an Assembly session during the scheduled recess, since the Senate is not 
going to interrupt their vacation. Burton's request, in conjunction with the 
Speaker's trouble in getting enough of his members to return on their own 
dime (he didn't want the Assembly to pay for people to fly back from European 
vacations for 48 hours - and few members were willing to pay for it 
themselves), means there will probably not be a hearing on Hertzberg's Edison 
bailout plan tomorrow.
Since Hertzberg plan is different from the bill the Senate passed, Burton 
wants Hertzberg to include the Senate in discussions on a solution that can 
get passed in both houses. Since it is not expected to be any hearing on any 
bills/Edison bailout before both houses return from the summer recess on 
August 20th - we look  for negotiations to occur on extending the MOU's Aug 
15th deadline."

Thanks.  I was glad to do it and would do it again... next time my computer 
will work.
I benefitted a great deal from what I heard from the group, especially 
regarding the PRC.

		 Subject: Presentation at ETS HR Employee Meeting

Steve . . . 

FYI -- we conducted a post-event survey on opinions about the HR employee 
meeting held last month and the HR management team thought you should know 
that participants rated your presentation very high.

When asked what should be kept the same next time, participants commented as 
follows about your presentation:
""I think a presentation from Corporate HR is of great value.""
""Keep the presentations by the officers . . . to talk about the business.""
""I liked having other people from ETS/Enron there to better understand the 
big picture and where Enron is going.""
""Continue to bring in invited guests to keep the group apprised of Corporate 
activities. I liked the opportunity to hear both Stan and Steve--the field 
staff don't get as many opportunities to hear from corporate management.""
""Visits by Steve Kean and Stan Horton. Their perspectives are very good . . .""

Clearly, your participation provided much value to the group and we 
appreciate very much your taking the time to come meet with us and share 
information. 

You should expect that we'll be asking you to come back again!

Regards, - Roger

At or before the May 16th meeting in Hicksville, there is some basic
information that is needed for marketers to determine their regulatory risk
in accepting capacity from KeySpan East and West. KeySpan must provide , in
detail, for all transportation contracts (East and West) the following
information:

 - Max. Daily Quantity
 - Telescoping (Receipt and Delivery Points/ Amounts available at
different delivery points)
 - Rate Schedules
 - Pipeline
 - Start Date
 - End Date
 - Current Rates (Demand, Variable, Fuel %, Surcharges)
 - Any proposed pipeline rate changes that take effect in the next
year (effective Date)
 - Map the gas flow of contracts, if transportation feeds into other
transportation contracts.
 - Identify contracts used for storage W/D or Inj.
 - Identify historical (past 24 months) geographic basis differential
to the NYMEX for each receipt point on the different transportation
contracts

KeySpan should explain the contractual and operational restrictions for not
releasing a slice of the system. The percentage of secondary delivery
capacity needs to be defined and KeySpan should inform marketers of any
preliminary negations for incremental purchases and the pricing terms to
serve the firm market.

Subject: Re: Good News!-PRAISE REPORT  

I have a praise report to share.  
 I was touched as was everyone else who read the prayer request for Kat.   I 
delivered my donation to Darlene by hand  because she is on the floor below 
me.  I believe the Lord gave me an amount to give and I was obedient (my mind 
was saying you shouldn't!  You will need this money yourself!)   I believe 
because I was obedient the Lord has blessed me.   Luke 6:38 "" Give and it 
shall be given good measure , pressed down, shaken together and running over 
shall men give unto your bosom.  For with the same measure you mete it shall 
be measured again unto you.""    I believe that the new testament church 
operated the way we Christians are supposed to.    Helping each other and 
manifesting the love of God.
To make a long story kinda short.   The Lord use a seemingly awful situation 
to  work out for good.  My son missed his airplane back to school.  We spent 
the whole day Sunday in the airport on standby trying to get a flight on 
overbooked airplanes.   He ended up having to wait for a flight this Monday 
to get back to school on time.  It was urgent that he be back before 3:00 
today.   I paid additional money to book him on a flight that had an 
available seat leaving a t 10:00 am this morning. The flight  would arrive 
too late but was the only thing we could obtain.     One of the agents was 
led of the Lord, I believe,  to help us and told us to get to the airport at 
5: 00 this morning and get  on the stand-by list for the 6:00am  flight which 
was also overbooked,  and maybe my son had a chance of getting on.   We did 
as she said and sure enough he was able to get on board and get to his 
destination at 12:45 today. (My son said to me ""Mom lets pray that I will be 
able to get on this flight"" as we passed through security to get to the 
boarding gate).     Praise the LORD!   The gate person gave him a real ticket 
for a real seat when he gave his name at the gate.  The story does not end 
there.   Another flight person taking the luggage remembered us from the 
previous day , found that we had been bumped the day before even though my 
son had been number 1 in line to get a seat on the next flight out .  This 
woman gave us back the money I had to pay for rescheduling the flight , PLUS 
A FREE ROUND TRIP TICKET TO ANYWHERE WE WANT TO GO! 
 PRESSED DOWN SHAKEN TOGETHER AND RUNNING OVER!!!!   IT IS TRULY MORE BLESSED 
TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE.  We can't out give God!  
Blessings,
Juanita

There's no way Thank you is enough. I cannot believe the out pour of help 
that came my way.  My load has been lifted considerably, I have a smile on my 
face.  Our God is an awesome God.  He reign's from Heaven about with power 
and love, our God is an awesome God.  I have gotten so many card and letters 
it is unbelievable.  I am so overwhelmed by all of this I can't help but to 
cry.  When people don't even know you they come to your rescue. The Lord is 
going to Bless each and every one of them richly.  Tell all of them I said I 
love them with love of the Lord.  If there is anything I can ever do please, 
please call on me.  The Lord is going to Bless me to be in a position one 
day, I can help someone it is just a matter of time.  And for you Darlene - I 
Love You.  You have always showed concern for me and my family, even when you 
were having problems yourself.  I just Love You!!! May the Lord continue to 
Bless you and your family abundantly. Can I send an e-mail to the saints, the 
one I have their name?  Let me know.  Keep me on your prayer list I will be 
going to the doctor, that always makes me a wreck.  Also, have you heard 
anything about lil Michael?  I want to know how he is doing, I am so sure the 
Lord pulled him though. Please let me know.  I will write again tomorrow, my 
son just walked in I do not want my kids to know my situation, they do not 
need stress, especially him.   I Love you all.

Be Blessed in Jesus Name.
Kat

There have been some issues that I have noticed in the last week or so that I 
would like to address:

There have been several instances during the day, where we have noticed tasks 
that have not been completed during the night shift.  Pursuant to that, I 
would like to follow-up the January 18 meeting by outlining the duties that 
are expected to be completed by the end of each night shift.

The night duty task priorities are as follows: 

1.  Identify Hourly Position

2.  Manage Positions 

3.  Trade the remainder of On-peak & Off-peak.

*4.  Verbal Hourly P & L checkout 

*5.  Next-day pre-schedule checkout 

6.  Track each hour Index prices (PJM, NY-ISO & NEPOOL)

7.  Book Transfers to respective Hourly books from ST & LT books for position 
liquidations (Effectively making all the Hourly books flat)  * Instructions 
will be provided

8.  Develop and distribute the Shift Note

*9.  P&L to Enpower Reconciliation for each book (Hourly: Mid-west, 
Southeast, Northeast and ERCOT. Books should be flat by the a.m.)

* The highlighted items are the duties that need constant attention and are 
of the utmost importance.

If there are any problems or questions regarding positions, deals done during 
the day or schedule check-out difficulties, that cannot be resolved by 
investigation, please call or page either Juan, Jester, Richard or myself.

I know that we are still training some new guys, however, there are things 
that must be done at night.  If there us something that you do not know how 
to do, ask until you find an acceptable answer.

If there are any questions, give me a shout on my cell phone.

Thanks,

Don

Dave, we are in the process of making offers to two individuals in Toronto 
for the purposes of covering gas marketing reporting to Eric Le Dain. Lavo 
and I discussed mid-year last year that we needed someone to cover the 
utilities and someone to cover industrials. It has been a difficult hiring 
process, but we are now there.  I would envision both of these marketers 
working closely with Storey on mid-market transactions with Eric's 
involvement on structured/originated transactions.

Subject: Eastern Canada

Guys, I can't recall how the corporate opportunity is managed between Canada 
and the US for these customers particularily with regard to their 
transactions in Michigan et al.  Is Eastern Canada now managed by the Central 
desk from a trading and mid-market point of view since Story came down to 
Houston? How are the structured deals managed?  Is this still the right split 
for the business?

Subject: Eastern Canada

As we continue to define goals/objectives and coverage staffing in alignment 
with the corresponding trading group, I assumed that Eastern Canada 
origination would fall within the central region.  Specifically opportunities 
with Enbridge, Consumers and Union due to mid-market/trading coverage 
previously being at the central desk.  I understand there is history to this 
division and I have no desire to start any new issues or create larger 
organizational issues.   In the gas re-organization, how did you 
strategically divide Eastern Canada?

I would appreciate your direction or decision.

Thanx,
Laura

1. Ms. Lewis' information does not appear to be in the lotus notes entry for 
ECI-Bear that I have used for the past two weeks.  Re: lotus notes, however, 
I certainly could be wrong. If you are certain, please point out or forward.

2.  You indicated in our meeting in my office that someone represented that 
Bear does not need the standard accompanying documents to open the account.  
As per my email request yesterday evening, can you confirm who determined 
this (if it was not you) so that I know what is going on and what I can 
represent in talking with the people at Bear?

Sara, I have stopped by your office but you are not around.  Please provide 
the following information/clarification in light of your conversations with 
other folks:

1. We do not have to send Bear the Officers/Traders list and other documents 
with the agreements to get things moving?

2.  If we do, then who do I contact or ask Richard Sage to contact to get 
this information re: the correct slate of officers updated?  No one has 
advised me of these steps.  And actually, if we have to do this, I would like 
Stephanie to take the lead on finishing her work on this part of the project.

3. Re: this attorney Cheryl at Bear  that you have talked to -- what is her 
full name, phone, and fax?


Thanx.

Lauri,   From a legal standpoint, we can cut the nomination on an 
interruptible agreement at our discretion.  The contract clearly gives us 
this right.  I haven't specifically reviewed the contract, but I am assuming 
it is our standard form.  I will check this.

Yes, I would consider HISD facilities to be state facilities.  The fact that 
this goes to Entex first complicates the issue.  

Dan,  was the intent that it be directly delivered to state facilities, or if 
it ultimately ended up at state facilities?

I haven't heard anything back from you guys on this.  Any insight?  I know 
Linda Roberts is also working a deal with TGLO to convert bbls to mmbtus 
which could mean incremental volumes that TGLO would be trying to get into 
Midcon.

Gerald/Eric-

I have a couple of questions regarding TGLO transport contract 
012-88494-202.  We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into various 
Midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to 
Reliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport 
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether 
the gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then, 
is:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are 
considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered 
to them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference?

I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the 
correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be 
if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas 
into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I 
would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the 
Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough 
leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily?

Thanks for your help.

John:

As we discussed, I am sending you a letter summarizing the law related to
double-breasted issues, with particular focus on operating two companies in
the same geographic and project market.  I also have included some
information, as you requested, about the potential liability if the efforts
to maintain double-breasted status fail.

I will send the original of this letter to you by mail.  I have copied this
letter to Michelle Cash but have not sent it to anybody else in your
organization because of your prior comments about David Lund's direct
contact with me.  Let me know if you want me to forward a copy of this to
David, Rick Johnson, or anybody else.

If you have any questions about this letter or this topic in general, please
let me know.

Essay
California Power Failure
By WILLIAM SAFIRE

01/11/2001
The New York Times
Page 31, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

LOS ANGELES -- In the past decade, California has become the most Democratic 
state in the nation. It has a Democratic governor, two liberal Democratic 
senators, and both houses of its legislature are firmly in Democratic hands. 
Not for nothing is it called the Left Coast. 
Then why, Californians now ask themselves, is their state the most troubled 
in the nation? Bad enough that Hollywood's writers are preparing to strike; 
worse that speculators in Silicon Valley start-ups are watching their stack 
of chips dwindle; worst of all is the unforeseen electricity shock that is 
making the state's hair stand on end.
The price of electricity is soaring, yet the big electric utilities are 
threatened by bankruptcy. Who's to blame? 
The chosen villain: deregulation. As soon as cruel market forces were allowed 
to work, cry liberal voices, those heartless capitalists drove up prices. 
Bring back the cool, calm days of inefficient monopolies under government 
control. 
But in fact, the first villain is botched deregulation -- not as bad as in 
Russia, but 'tis enough, 'twill do. 
California's politicians deregulated halfway, which is the worst way: 
wholesale prices were freed from controls, but retail prices were not. 
Consumers remained seemingly protected, but the utility companies -- which 
foolishly thought wholesale prices would go down forever -- were enabled to 
buy on the spot market. Legislators believing they were protecting consumers 
forbade long-term contracts, which are hedges against sudden price 
fluctuations. 
This halfway dereg ran smack into the inexorable law of supply and demand. 
The good times of the 90's sharply increased demand for electric power. But 
all sorts of obstacles were put in the way of increasing the supply of that 
power. 
Result: upward pressure on prices, calls for rationing, utilities going 
broke, government intervention that frightens off private investment, and the 
danger of an economic Big One in the state responsible for 13 percent of the 
nation's product. 
The unspoken issue in this bastion of liberalism is ''nimby'' -- the real 
villain in the current supply crisis, that says ''not in my backyard'' to 
power plants. In San Jose, epicenter of the computer industry's drain on 
electric power, New Economy voters recently rejected a new power facility 
that offended their aesthetic sensibilities. Red tape and purple rhetoric are 
the reasons no major power station has been built in California in 10 years. 
Contrary to popular belief, electricity does not come from the socket in the 
wall. The steady flow of low-cost power comes from factories that convert 
energy from other sources into the stuff that makes toasters pop, 
air-conditioners wheeze and computers beep. Unless energy is dug up and 
produced in real places and transmitted through real lines, nothing comes out 
of the wall. 
Environmentalists recoil in horror at suggestions of nuclear power, now a 
safe and clean source of electricity, or the use of cleaned-up coal to lower 
the price of natural gas that generates it. Reducing pollution sensibly is 
laudable, but clean-air extremists become local heroes without telling 
constituents the danger of loss of Intel jobs and cheap electricity's 
household convenience. 
The answer is not re-regulation, nor more halfwayism, nor federal bailout. 
When Gov. Gray Davis of California raced to Washington, D.C., to ask for 
wholesale price controls, he found Bill Clinton too busy carving up Jerusalem 
to mediate; Clinton-appointed federal energy bureaucrats offer only 
palliatives, with photo op to follow. 
Davis's panicked proposal to build state-owned plants (in Nevada? On the 
moon?) and his threat to seize the assets of ''price gougers'' may please 
some new breed of dot-communists. But such populist pap destroys private 
incentive to invest and is hardly the path for a presidential hopeful 
professing to be a centrist. 
After short-term action to alleviate hardship caused by past and present 
political-industrial blindness, our biggest state should avoid regressing 
into more stultifying regulation and instead get out of the way of 
stimulating supply. 
Why do I sound like a reformed drunk on this? Because I wrote the Nixon 
speech imposing wage and price controls. They never work in peacetime. Never.

Certainly if we are able to generate revenue, that will be a great offset to 
our expenses.  At this point, we are working on a best, worst and most likely 
case for a revenue model, plus getting some teeth behind our up front costs.  
With this info, we can size the potential and then decide how to proceed.  

My first note to you around disbanding Joel's group was the best overall 
summary of reasons to disband the team.  In addition, Joel and his team had 
recently spent a couple of hours updating my direct report team on the 
projects in which they were involved.  The update had the exact opposite 
effect that Joel wanted, I am sure.  After the two hour session, it appeared 
to me that the team was probably overstaffed and still adding to its girth, 
fulfilling IT's roles in some cases, not communicating with the rest of my 
direct report team (if your role is be a liaison, then communication is a 
necessary component of the role), struggling to create a role for themselves, 
etc.  If my reaction had been to say ""what a talented group - we have to 
figure out how to best utilize them"", then the outcome might have been 
different.  But I also had concerns over quality of staff as well.  That two 
hour exposure created so much concern on my part that we were incurring costs 
for the team without commensurate value, that I couldn't in good conscious 
make any other decision after further investigation.  --Sally

Thanks for this - given volume increases and our need to develop and test new

Subject: Disbanding of Joel Henenberg's Team

I have a stretch goal for the operations budget under Enron Americas to 
reduce costs by the end of the year.  To this end, I have recently studied 
possible options for reaching the targeted savings.  To make the best 
decision on this, I have reviewed functions within my team on the basis of 
core versus non-core functions, and the inherent cost versus value 
proposition.

As a result, I made the decision last week to disband Joel Henenberg's team.  
To fulfill the role of Joel and his team in leading IT initiatives, we will 
lean on the appropriate IT project managers and the business sponsors/end 
users.   

Joel and his team were told of this decision on Friday afternoon last week.  
Our HR rep spent some time with the team explaining the corporate 
re-deployment service that they all will be working through over the next few 
weeks.  
Let me know if you have any questions regarding this.  While it was a tough 
decision, I feel comfortable having made it.

Thanks for the joke, it provided me with a well needed chuckle (You and 
Darren definitely have too much time on your hands).  As for the hat/casual 
western theme, we are going to have to go to make a trip to Blanco's or Tin 
Hall sometime so I can don the full regalia."

Are you here?  I wanted to get those Intergen consents done and out of the

they want more copies), and I thought it would be best if you initialled.

Opps. Sorry about the confusion.  We are selling the equity in CA to Coral, 
so I call it by that name.  I'm looking for a list of what you need as 
referencedin the last line of this email.

Hope that helps,

Kay,
   Attached are the latest versions of the CA Energy Development
breakout agreements.  Please note that, because the agreements deal with
only one Unit each, the term ""Unit Liability Amount"" has been replaced
with ""Maximum Liability Amount.""  Also, there is no need for an Exhbit
N-1, so that reference has been deleted as well.  The agreement is still
missing an Agreement Reference number, Ben Jacoby's fax number, and the
information needed for the exhibits.  Thanks, Chris

		 Subject: FW: footnnote each item under Exhibit B



REGARDING THE SETTLEMENT, ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT

Tracy Ngo correctly pointed out volumetric ambiguities on the two original
confirmations between Avista Energy and PG&E Energy Trading.

Let me summarize below:

(1) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 404335 showed Total Volume
of 982,400 MWh's.  PG&E revised the Total Volume to 981,600 MWh.  Avista did
not respond with an affirmation of the corrected volume.  Our records show
that the original volume of 982,400 is correct (there was a leap-year day in
year 2000).  The broker confirm and the PG&E revision seem to be both in
error.  Obviously any new confirm that is written between Avista Energy and
Enron will have the proper Total Volume for the remaining MWh's.  Since this
Assignment references the original confirmation, our counsel recommends
language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email from
Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&E and
Enron? Please advise.

(2) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 403862 showed a Total
Volume of 14,400.  PG&E accepted the confirm ""as is.""  The broker
confirmation shows total volume correctly as 876,000 MWh's.  Therefore, both
PG&E and AVISTA screwed up.  HOwever, we acknowledge that the total MWh's
should correctly be as per the broker confirmation.  Again, our counsel
recommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see
email from Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to
PG&E and Enron?  Please advise.


To reiterate, we realize that there will be new confirmations between Enron
and Avista.  Enron has traditionally written the confirmations (Enron's
confirm's prevail).  Therefore, the new confirms should be acceptable.  We
would like to see those confirms in advance if possible.

Lastly, time is of the essense.  We are scheduling power already for January
deliveries....therefore, we must act quickly on this assignment so as to
prevent any problems with scheduling, etc.  I suppose that we could delay
the start dates to February 1st, 2001 if necessary.  Perhaps not a big
issue.

Thanks,

Hi Eric,
 
It looks like Enron employees have an enterprising spirit according to the H. Chronicle.  Ebay is saturated with Enron goodies.  This is quite amusing.
 
Sorry about tonight and we will miss you on your birthday.  We will celebrate whenever you wish, just let us know.  If you change your mind about tomorrow, email me.  Donnita and Jason are coming over for dinner.  We would love for you to come.

Folks:
Here are my edits.  For simplicity, I accepted all the other changes and put 
mine in strike-out-underline.

They are confined to the direct access section, and to the provisions 
regarding ""spot market service"" in particular.  Based on our negotiations, I 
think it's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as 
""an option to elect.""  Instead, the language in the agreement states that it 
is a ""backstop,"" in the event that on any given day a customer's ESP doesn't 
show up with the power.  In effect, it retains the utility's duty to serve, 
like the gas side, but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost 
recovery for the spot service provided.  I've also added provisions which 
obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the 
outset of the program (i.e., the transition date), the customer, for whatever 
reason fails to elect Term Service or Direct Access Service.  In both cases, 
the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days, after which the customer 
must choose Term or Direct Access Service.

Please take a look at the language.  While I haven't put any ""stakes in the 
ground"" up till now, I feel strongly about these changes (for reasons I'm 
happy to discuss), and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the 
document, I'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss.  I believe 
that the language as proposed captures my conversation with Dorothy.

In addition, I've also taken a stab at language requested by Delainey, i.e., 
""what to do about DA in the interm?""  There may be better ways to craft the 
language, but I took a shot nonetheless.

Finally, I'm assuming, based on yesterday's call, that, by delivering this 
document to the Speaker today, no one is giving their approval, support, or 
anything else for each and every provision.  I'm not prepared to, and cannot, 
do that at this time.

Thanks again to all for all the effort (and to Dorothy for her patience in 
hearing me out earlier).

Best,

Thanks for your note.  I really enjoyed visiting with you over dinner.  I am 
so glad to hear that you will be joining us at Enron this summer.  I know 
that you will find it to be an exciting place.  Please let me know what your 
start date will be.  I would love to schedule a lunch with you soon after you 
arrive.  I hope that you will consider me a ready resource for any questions 
that you have both before you arrive and once you are in the door at Enron.

Subject: 24 x 5 Products

Eric Bass, Texas Desk trader, requested the following product described below 
be traded on EnronOnline. This product will NOT bridge into Sitara and will 
have to be put in manually. 

The reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple 
stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date. Currently, 
EnronOnline can
only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge 
monitor and will have to be manually entered into Sitara & subsequently 
cleared out of the monitor. 

Since these transactions could flow next day, it is imperative that these 
transactions get into Sitara as soon as possible. Please read the FULL 
description below. (This product looks like a month long deal but excludes 
weekends. The ""Wkd"" is short for week days.)

We do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be 
prepared to react quickly when they do. For the future, we are looking into 
the cost/benefit of EnronOnline having the capability of sending multiple 
dates for these types of products.

If you have any questions, please call me at 3-5824
Thank you.

Subject: 24 x 5 Products

We are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 Nat Gas Product commencing tomorrow, 
May 24th. 

The Product is a month-long Physical Nat Gas Product traded off the Texas 
desk. It will be identified as follows:

US Gas Phy       Exxon Katy WkD          Jun00           USD/MM

This Product is different from the usual Products traded on the Texas Desk in 
that the Product  description has an 
indicator of  WkD, which designates that the Product only moves gas on a day 
that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, 
Thursday or Friday.

These Products WILL NOT bridge into Sitara. Risk personnel will need to be 
diligent to identify these Products based 
on the information in the Product Description to ensure that the Products are 
entered into Sitara correctly (presumably - 
strips of Monday-Friday trades and the corresponding month-starting days 
and/or month-ending days).

We understand the potential impact of having to manually input these 
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between EOL and Sitara and consider 
building bridge capability. In the
interim, we anticipate that the trading volume on these Products will be low, 
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase.

Tana,

I may have a need for legal review of a draft MOU and agreement with Oracle 
in the near future.  Dovie tells me you are our primary contact.  

What is the best process for scheduling time for legal support on an MOU?

yes-I am coming or all of us are coming for at least part of the party.  My
nephew/godson #2 birthday is the same day.  So I will be by for a bit.
I will see you then.

By the way, I am assuming that the ""cabana"" is at your house.  Is this
correct?

Shemin,

Here is a draft instruction letter that MRT prepared in anticipation of hearing that everything was approved by the Creditor's Committee.  I will double check the contract numbers and entity names this afternoon and will let you know if they don't match up with the letter.  Also, we will need to change the date of the letter and put it on EES/EEM or Enron Corp. letterhead.

Thanks for your help and keep your fingers crossed that the Committee says yes,
Ruth

    FYI 

It is anticipated that Enron will announce later this week, a new ""Employee 
Stock Option Plan"". 

Approximately 45 days ago we analyzed the cost of EOTT's participation in 
this program.  The cost impact was $2.5 - $3.0 for each year over the next 
five years with no provision of supervesting in the event a business group 
was divested during the term of the grant.  Based on these factors, a 
decision was made for EOTT not to participate in the program at this time.

While EOTT employees will not directly receive communications on this 
program, it is possible that the senior leadership group could receive a 
question on EOTT's participation.   We have elected not to send an EOTT 
employee communication about nonparticipation to avoid raising the issue 
where not necessary.

If you receive questions, you may refer the individual to me or answer with 
the appropriate response based on the information in this e-mail.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation and support of this decision.  If 
you have further questions or comments, please advise."

Thanks for the response.  We had previously received the response regarding
the SPCC plan issue but I had not seen the responses for the Lincoln
facility (although I had received Gleason last week).  Just to confirm what
is outstanding:  The questions relating to all facilities sent on 10/23,
the questions relating to Wheatland sent on 10/23, the questions relating
to LV Cogen I and II sent on 10/23, and the questions relating to the LV
Cogen I and II schedules sent on 10/25.  Please let me know if this is not
consistent with your understanding of what is outstanding.  Thanks.

P.S.  You had also indicated in your 10/25 email that the letter from TDEC
regarding the Subpart GG variance would be faxed to me.  To date, I have
not yet received it.  Thanks.

Mark- here is my response to your request. Call with questions.

Goal:
Total Foreign Exchange Exposure quantified and communicated to BOD.

Performance:
Project completed with final tranche of results reported to Finance Committee 
Dec 11. The notional exposure as well as impact on potential impact on 
earnings and CTA accounts have been quantified and reported to the BOD over 
the past year according to a schedule that has strictly adhered to. Also, a 
template and process has been established to be able to easily report changes 
in the future. Enron has never had a comprehensive review of FX exposure 
prior to this activity. As an aside, there has been a fair amount of hedging 
activity resulting from this effort.

Goal:
Establish risk and trading control processes for risks unique to EES.

Performance:
Systems have been established and monitoring controls are in place across 
EES. A thorough study of the DSM business has been completed and the results 
presented to the Finance Committee. A RAC task force has been put in place 
which has established a work plan consisting of 53 elements that EES has 
agreed to put in place to get the overall back office and trading and credit 
control systems where they need to be. Significant progress has been made 
against these recommendations. DSM projects have been spot tested with 
outside measurement firm and the results reported to EES. These tests have 
highlighted focus areas to determine where the capital dollars are best 
employed.

Goal:
Solidify the global risk management policy beyond Houston and London.

Performance:
Complete and Ongoing. During 2000, Project Doorstep was initiated by RAC 
which inspected every office within Enron to determine if trading was taking 
place and if so whether the Enron controls were being adhered to. A data base 
system was developed to routinely prompt surprise inspections of these 
offices and also monitor if the recommendations are being adhered to. 
Doorstep was a huge effort involving RAC, AA, and operations to really 
understand where we have risks. It also helps in defining where we don't have 
responsibility such as EOTT,  Azurix  and The New Power Company."

RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:offi=
ce"" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

=20

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices=20

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

=20


General Observations


=20

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=
te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=
he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=
 all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =
much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=
d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=
rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=
ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=
t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=
o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=
iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=
 reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=
ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=
anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

=20


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Enron Prepares To Become Easier to Read

Can a humbler, more-informative Enron refuel investor enthusiasm?=20
That's the hope of Kenneth Lay, founder and chairman as well as the once an=
d once-again chief executive of this Houston energy and trading company. En=
ron has been regarded as one of the nation's most innovative -- though bede=
vilingly complicated -- companies. Mr. Lay acknowledges that Enron, which g=
rew into a colossus over the past decade with a hard-charging, in-your-face=
 management style, has ""lost some credibility"" with the investment communit=
y.
""I want to make sure we restore that credibility,"" he said in an interview =
last week.=20
He promises fuller disclosures, and Enron has a lot riding on whether inves=
tors find them sufficient -- and soothing. Last summer, the company's stock=
 price hit $90 a share, giving Enron a dazzling price-to-earnings ratio exc=
eeding 60. As of 4 p.m. in composite trading yesterday on the New York Stoc=
k Exchange, Enron was at $37.76, up $1.41, sporting a more-conventional P/E=
 ratio of about 21 times this year's expected earnings.=20
The stock slide has multiple causes, including uncertainty about trading pr=
ofits, due to the slower economy and a drop in energy prices as well as mou=
nting concerns about the difficulty that investors face in figuring out how=
 the company's extremely complex operations make money.=20
Layer on management turnover. Earlier this month, Enron lost its chief exec=
utive when Jeffrey Skilling, Mr. Lay's longtime lieutenant and handpicked s=
uccessor, unexpectedly resigned after only about six months in the top job.=
 The 47-year-old Mr. Skilling was widely credited with helping to build Enr=
on into the nation's leading energy trader and personified the company's br=
ash manner. During an investor conference call in April, for example, when =
a caller criticized Enron's schedule for releasing financial information, M=
r. Skilling responded by calling him an ""ah."" Mr. Skilling, who is on a riv=
er rafting trip, couldn't be reached for comment but others at the company,=
 including Mr. Lay, say it was an unfortunate word choice that continues to=
 haunt the company. At the time, Mr. Skilling said he regretted if anyone w=
as offended by his remark.=20
Though Mr. Skilling initially said his resignation was strictly for persona=
l reasons, he added in a later interview that his own feelings of failure o=
ver the plummeting stock price had contributed greatly to his early departu=
re. The 59-year-old Mr. Lay resumed the chief executive's job that he had p=
reviously held for 15 years.=20
Jeff Dietert, an analyst from Simmons & Co. International in Houston, figur=
es that Enron's P/E is likely to be permanently lower, though still somewha=
t higher than the average for its peer group. Mr. Dietert views Dynegy as t=
he premium energy stock, which will fetch the highest trading multiple.=20
While Mr. Lay insists that Enron's overall operating and financial conditio=
n is very strong, the unexpected exit of Mr. Skilling has some wondering if=
 ""there isn't another shoe about to drop,"" says Carol Coale, an analyst at =
Prudential Securities.=20
To lessen such concerns, Mr. Lay promises to address the longtime analyst a=
nd investor complaint that Enron doesn't provide enough information about i=
ts extremely complex operations, which include not only construction of nat=
ural-gas pipelines and power plants but the trading of an ever-expanding ar=
ray of commodities. Nowadays, Enron trades everything from telecommunicatio=
ns capacity to weather-linked derivative contracts.=20
""I truly do not understand all their financial arrangements, and I've sent =
information on their deals to accountant friends and they don't understand =
them either,"" says Rebecca Followill, an analyst at Howard Weil, who refers=
 to Enron's accounting methods as a ""black box.""=20
Yet analysts long put out buy recommendations on Enron stock, in large part=
 because the company has issued consistently strong earnings. In 2000, for =
example, the company reported net income rose 10% to $979 million on revenu=
e that more than doubled to $100 billion. Assets over the past five years m=
ore than quadrupled to about $65 billion.=20
""When the stock price and earnings were going up so quickly, less attention=
 was paid to the quality of earnings,"" says Zach Wagner, an analyst at Edwa=
rd Jones in St. Louis. With the stock price down, ""Enron has to show that t=
hey do have quality earnings. The only way to do that is to open up the boo=
ks,"" he says.=20
Mr. Lay says Enron will start putting out more detailed information on indi=
vidual business segments and ""give a better idea of the profitability of va=
rious businesses"" such as its wholesale-services category where a lot of bu=
siness activities gets lumped.=20
In another bow to criticism, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow as of Ju=
ly 31 quietly ended his ownership and management ties with certain limited =
partnerships. Over the past two years, Enron has placed billions of dollars=
 of assets and millions of shares of its stock into complex transactions wi=
th these partnerships. Enron executives say the transactions were perfectly=
 proper and that the company asked Mr. Fastow to take part in the deals, wh=
ich were done to reduce the risk of fluctuating market prices. An Enron spo=
kesman says Mr. Fastow has no comment on the matter.=20
Yet some analysts say they have been concerned about having Enron's top fin=
ancial executive in a fiduciary position at entities that, at least potenti=
ally, stood to gain if the company lost in the transactions -- and vice ver=
sa. Mr. Lay says the transactions involving Mr. Fastow had become a ""lightn=
ing rod"" for criticism so ""we're better off not doing it.""=20
Of course, it's still a challenge trying to make sense of these transaction=
s. Consider the following snippet from Enron's second-quarter report concer=
ning some Fastow-related deals: ""Enron has entered into agreements with ent=
ities formed in 2000, which included the obligation to deliver 12 million s=
hares of Enron common stock in March 2005 and entered into derivative instr=
uments which eliminated the contingent nature of existing restricted forwar=
d contracts executed in 2000. . . . In exchange, Enron received notes recei=
vable from the Entities totaling approximately $827.6 million. In addition,=
 Enron entered into share settled costless collar arrangements with the Ent=
ities on the 12 million shares of Enron common stock. Such transactions wil=
l be accounted for as equity transactions when settled. Enron received a $6=
.5 million note receivable from the Entities to terminate share-settled opt=
ions on 7.1 million shares of Enron common stock. The transactions resulted=
 in noncash increases to noncurrent assets and equity.""=20
Reading Enron's financial statements can make ""you kind of step back and sa=
y, `What?'"" says Jeff Dietert, the analyst at Simmons.=20
Enron faces challenges beyond just financial opaqueness. It is owed $500 mi=
llion for power delivered to California's troubled utilities -- a much bigg=
er unpaid tab than analysts originally believed. In India, Enron is having =
difficulty getting paid for electricity from its 65%-owned, $3-billion Dabh=
ol power project because of a dispute with government officials over power =
prices. Mr. Lay says Dabhol is among the approximately $5 billion in overse=
as assets that Enron plans to sell over the next three years while keeping =
$4 billion in such holdings.=20
Mr. Lay also must create a post-Skilling succession plan. He says he will s=
oon recommend to the board the names of one or two executives to join him i=
n the office of chairman.=20

The State PG&E's Power Bill May Go Up Energy: The PUC wants to shift some o=

 a 12% rate hike for SDG&E.

SACRAMENTO -- California regulators plan to shift roughly $250 million a ye=
ar of the cost of buying power for the state away from financially troubled=
 Southern California Edison to Pacific Gas & Electric, which already is in =
bankruptcy.=20
The move, part of a draft decision issued Monday by Loretta M. Lynch, presi=
dent of the state Public Utilities Commission, is a step toward completing =
plans for repaying the state treasury for money spent buying electricity on=
 behalf of the state's three major private utilities--Edison, PG&E and San =
Diego Gas & Electric.
The PUC also issued a draft decision that would increase the electricity ra=
tes of San Diego customers by an average of 12%.=20
Another draft decision would suspend the ability of electricity customers s=
tatewide to choose their own power provider. That decision was a blow to el=
ectricity-generating firms, such as Enron and AES NewEnergy, which had lobb=
ied hard to maintain the ability to sell directly to customers--mostly larg=
e businesses--that have chosen not to buy power from the local utility.=20
The five-member commission will vote on the measures Sept. 6.=20
The proposals are designed to assure a flow of revenue to the state Departm=
ent of Water Resources, which has been buying power for utility customers m=
ost of this year. The state's power crisis saddled the utilities with so mu=
ch debt that earlier this year they became financially unable to buy power =
on behalf of their customers.=20
The Department of Water Resources has been paying for power out of the stat=
e treasury. To reimburse the treasury, the state plans to float a $12.5-bil=
lion bond issue. Those bonds would be paid off by customers of the three ut=
ilities.=20
One of the issues before the PUC has been how much of the cost of those bon=
ds should be carried by each of the three utility companies.=20
The Department of Water Resources had proposed charging each utility the sa=
me amount per customer. But the PUC's proposed order calls for splitting th=
e cost among the utilities according to how much it costs the department to=
 provide power to each of them. ""The utilities argued that it was discrimin=
atory to have their customers subsidizing other customers' costs,"" Lynch to=
ld a news conference. ""And we agreed.""=20
""Instead of giving all utilities the same allocation of cost equally,"" she =
said, ""we instead dig down behind the numbers to determine how much it actu=
ally costs"" to serve each of the utility's customers.=20
The PUC's analysis determined that the cost of serving Edison is lower than=
 the cost of serving PG&E. The resulting decision shifts $500 million in pa=
yments from Edison to PG&E over the next two years.=20
Edison customers, however, will not see a drop in their electricity bills. =
Whatever money is left over after the Department of Water Resources takes i=
ts share can be used by Edison to cover the costs of its own power producti=
on and purchases. The PUC is now holding hearings to determine just how muc=
h of what is left over should go to Edison.=20
Whether the rates paid by PG&E customers would actually go up under the PUC=
 proposal remains unclear. But PG&E officials condemned the shift as unfair=
.=20
""If adopted by the [PUC] this would lock our customers into 40% to 55% high=
er rates for DWR power over the next 10 years, compared to customers of Sou=
thern California Edison and SDG&E,"" the company said in a statement. ""This =
massive cost shift was not proposed by DWR, discriminates against PG&E's cu=
stomers, and has not been subject to public review, due process, or cost ju=
stification by DWR or the [PUC].""=20
The PUC's actions are intended to convince Wall Street that the state will =
be able to repay the bond issue. In general, the draft orders issued Monday=
 mirror an earlier proposed agreement that essentially insulates the Depart=
ment of Water Resources from PUC reviews of electricity rate increases. But=
 the decision by the PUC to alter the way the department's power-buying cos=
ts are allocated among the major utilities was a significant change.=20
Steve Maviglio, Gov. Gray Davis' press secretary, said the fact that the PU=
C was putting in place the legal machinery necessary for the bond sale is ""=
a positive step in moving the ball forward.""=20
Maviglio denied that PG&E was being punished for choosing bankruptcy earlie=
r this year rather than cooperate with the Davis administration on a possib=
le rescue plan. ""It's all based on numbers and math; politics is not in the=
 equation,"" he said.=20
Spokesmen for Edison and SDG&E said they needed to study the draft decision=
s before commenting. The PUC will require the Department of Water Resources=
 to give it an updated revenue requirement in February, spelling out the ag=
ency's actual expenditure for the last year. That information will be used =
by the PUC to decide whether to adjust the electricity rates of utility cus=
tomers up or down. Any changes would show up in customers' bills next June,=
 Lynch said.=20
If approved by the full PUC, the proposed agreement would mean that the Dep=
artment of Water Resources, which has entered into $43 billion in long-term=
 contracts for power, will not be subject to PUC reviews. Lynch said state =
legislation gives the department the responsibility to review its own costs=
.=20
That lack of independent review worried consumer advocate Lenny Goldberg, a=
 lobbyist for the Utility Reform Network. ""Just accepting DWR at whole clot=
h is an abdication of how ratepayers ought to be treated,"" he said.=20
Goldberg said he hopes the Legislature passes a bill by Sen. John Burton (D=
-San Francisco) that would give the PUC authority to scrutinize the water a=
gency's costs.=20
But Davis' advisors say such scrutiny could frighten Wall Street investors =
and hurt the state's ability to sell bonds at a favorable price. The propos=
ed PUC order raising electricity rates for many of SDG&E's 1.2 million cust=
omers would become effective no later than Oct. 1. Rates for PG&E and Ediso=
n customers were increased earlier this year. The average rate hike for SDG=
&E customers amounts to 1.4 cents per kilowatt-hour--less than half of the =
rate hike approved for utility customers elsewhere.=20
Lynch said the proposed increase for SDG&E is lower because its customers b=
ore the full cost of electricity in California's haywire electricity market=
 last summer. While Edison and PG&E customers were protected by a rate free=
ze, SDG&E customers saw their bills double and in some cases triple before =
the Legislature stepped in to cap rates last September.=20
To encourage conservation, the San Diego rate hike is structured so that re=
sidential customers who use no more than 130% of a baseline amount would no=
t experience any increase. Baseline is the number of kilowatt-hours that su=
pposedly meets the minimum needs of an average household in a particular re=
gion. The average increases would be 18% for small commercial customers and=
 19% for industrial firms.=20
The move to suspend the right of consumers to buy power directly from gener=
ators would put an end to one of the major selling points for the state's f=
ailed 1998 deregulation plan. Supporters of direct access, as the consumer-=
choice provision is known, were especially dismayed that the PUC said it wo=
uld suspend choice retroactive to July 1. Some companies, including AES New=
Energy, had pushed in recent weeks to sign up new customers before the opti=
on was eliminated. Those contracts would appear to be invalid if the PUC ad=
opts the draft decision.=20
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the suspension of the so-called direct a=
ccess program ""is incredible bad news for business.""=20
""It appears the only way to escape the California energy debacle is to esca=
pe California,"" she said.=20
State officials have said they could not allow direct access in order to en=
sure that all customers pay their share of the cost of reimbursing the stat=
e for its power purchases.=20

Enron Names Whalley, Frevert to Chairman's Office (Update1)

Enron Names Whalley, Frevert to Chairman's Office (Update1)

     (Adds background on the executives in second paragraph.)

     Houston, Aug. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, named company executives Greg Whalley and Mark
Frevert to the office of the chairman, two weeks after the
resignation of Jeffrey Skilling as chief executive.

     Whalley, 39 years old, was also named president and chief
operating officer. He previously held those titles for Enron
Wholesale Services, the energy- and commodity-trading unit that
accounted for almost all of the company's $50.1 billion in second-
quarter revenue. Frevert, 46, was chairman and chief executive of
Wholesale Services. He was named vice chairman, Enron said.

     Skilling, Enron's CEO since February, and Chairman Kenneth
Lay were the only executives in the office of the chairman, which
decides company strategy. Lay, who preceded Skilling as CEO, took
back that job after Skilling resigned. Lay's contract has been
extended to 2005.

     Skilling said Aug. 14 he resigned for personal and family
reasons, though he later said the recent drop in Enron's stock
price contributed to his decision. Shares of Houston-based Enron
have fallen 55 percent this year.

     The stock rose $1.41 to $37.76 yesterday.

NEW DELHI: US energy trading major Enron Corp has denied approaching Washin=

bout $483 million (Rs 2,270 crore) for its completion.=20
In a letter to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Saturday, a copy of w=

, appears to have caused significant, unintended concern. Counter to the im=
pression given in the story, I have not asked anyone in the US government t=

Lay said in his letter that Enron's approach was to settle the issue amicab=
ly by selling its stake. ""Furthermore, I did not say that the Dabhol power =
plant had been expropriated. Upon questioning from the publicator (publishe=

""Our preferred approach approach continues to be to resolve this issue amic=

However, Lay tempered his conciliatory stand by adding, ""Without agreement =

The stock market posted modest losses Monday after Friday's big rally, as t=
rading volume slowed to a crawl.=20
In commodity trading, natural gas prices plunged to 18-month lows amid an e=
xpected drop in demand from electricity generators this week.
On Wall Street the Dow industrials eased 40.82 points, or 0.4%, to 10,382.3=
5 while the Nasdaq composite slipped 4.39 points, or 0.2%, to 1,912.41.=20
On Friday the Dow soared 194.02 points and Nasdaq jumped 73.83 points after=
 Cisco Systems said its sales so far this quarter are meeting expectations.=
 The report raised fresh hopes that the technology sector is bottoming.=20
But the bulls couldn't keep the momentum going Monday. Losers outnumbered w=
inners by 17 to 13 on the New York Stock Exchange and by 20 to 16 on Nasdaq=
.=20
A weak report Monday on existing-home sales in July may have weighed on inv=
estor sentiment.=20
NYSE volume was anemic; it was the fourth-slowest full-day session this yea=
r.=20
""For the market to make a convincing case that we've ended the decline, it'=
s going to have to put together a few days in a row of advances or people a=
re going to look upon up days as an isolated situation,"" said Barry Hyman, =
chief investment strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.=20
Still, some analysts argued that the lack of heavy profit taking Monday was=
 a good sign.=20
""I would have thought that . . . we would have given back half of Friday's =
gains, and we didn't,"" said Larry Wachtel, market analyst for Prudential Se=
curities.=20
In the bond market, long-term yields were marginally higher.=20
Commodity trading was dominated by the action in natural gas prices. Near-t=
erm futures in New York fell 16.2 cents to $2.54 per million British therma=
l units, an 18-month low.=20
Traders said cooler weather in much of the country this week is expected to=
 cut demand for electricity to run air conditioners. Many power plants use =
natural gas to generate electricity, so gas demand could slide.=20
Among Monday's highlights:=20
* In the tech sector, Cisco slipped 24 cents to $18.01, Compaq lost 38 cent=
s to $13.27 and Veritas Software was off 66 cents to $34.83.=20
But Microsoft added 26 cents to $62.31 and Intel was up 7 cents to $29.15.=
=20
In the telecom sector, Verizon Communications fell 76 cents to $51.35 while=
 Sprint FON edged up 27 cents to $22.72.=20
* Energy stocks were mixed despite the plunge in natural gas prices. Enron =
gained $1.41 to $37.76 and El Paso rose 89 cents to $51.91, but Unocal lost=
 31 cents to $35.87 and Chevron fell 70 cents to $92.10.=20
* Blockbuster sank $1.60 to $20.35. The video chain's growth may be threate=
ned by a film-studio joint venture that would deliver movies over the Inter=
net, Barron's magazine said.=20
* The July home-sales report may have hurt online home-listing site Homesto=
re.com, which tumbled $2.98 to $18.60.=20
* Bank and thrift stocks were weak. Comerica fell $1.15 to $61.01, FleetBos=
ton lost 96 cents to $38.05 and City National eased 53 cents to $48.01.=20
* Some health-maintenance organization stocks resumed their recent rally. W=
ellPoint Health gained $1.56 to $108.54 and Oxford Health was up 92 cents t=
o $30.50. But Aetna fell $1.23 to $28.77.=20

NEW YORK -- Technology shares tried, and failed, to buck the negative trend=
 and turn in a positive performance. After spending much of the afternoon i=

Old Economy stocks spent most of the session on the downside and offered up=
 more examples of how employment softness is extending beyond technology.

 and Yahoo shedding 69 cents, to 13.42.=20
Old Economy stocks moved marginally on word that cutbacks were occurring. D=

Georgia-Pacific fell 15 cents to 37.02 after saying it will shut four paper=

J.P. Morgan Chase added 17 cents to 41.10 after a report in the Financial T=

with Chase Manhattan during the past year.=20
Cutbacks in the technology area continued. Hughes Electronics, the General =

Savings and loans were the session's worst performers, for a second day, on=
 sentiment that profits won't be as robust now that the Federal Reserve may=

1.22, to 55.85, New York Community Bancorp, which fell 1.97, or 5.1%, to 36=

 have their champions, including Lehman Brothers analyst Bruce Harting, who=
 called the selling ""irrational,"" and said the stocks have a lot of merit.=
=20
Water and gas utilities were the day's strongest groups, but their gains we=

Tyco International rose 21 cents to 53.61 after being named to the ""Top Pic=

It may take a quarter or two for investors to believe that ""there was not a=
nother shoe to drop related to Skilling's resignation,"" she said.=20
Enron's stock already had taken a beating this year, trading as high as $82=
 at the end of January and closing just under $43 before Skilling's announc=
ement.=20
After Skilling, a key player in Enron's transformation from a pipeline comp=
any to a trader of energy and other commodities such as metals and pulp and=
 paper, said he was leaving Enron for personal and family reasons, the stoc=

=20
The stock rose $1.41 to close in regular trading at $37.76 Monday.=20
Enron, analysts said, should be able to boost investor confidence by taking=
 a number of steps.=20
One -- expected to happen today -- is the naming of potential successors to=
 Skilling.=20
But the company also give must analysts the financial data they've been see=
king, resolve the India situation, sell off underperforming international a=
ssets and turn out positive earnings reports.=20
Enron got a fresh round of questions after Skilling left. That was despite =
assurances from Skilling and Enron Chairman Ken Lay, who stepped back into =
the chief executive and president roles, that Skilling wasn't fired and no =
negative disclosures about Enron were on the way.=20
Even though many analysts, some of whom met with Lay after Skilling left, g=
enerally seem to believe both points are true, investors apparently remain =
skeptical, especially in light of Enron's stock performance this year.=20
The stock took a big hit when Enron's broadband business fell apart as the =
telecommunications industry melted down.=20
Some analysts, though, believe Enron and Skilling oversold the business and=
 that some on Wall Street overvalued it. Based on certain calculations, Enr=
on touted broadband as an enterprise worth as much $40 a share in the stock=
 price.=20
Enron's link with telecommunications meant it got caught both on the upside=
 and downside of the bubble, said Raymond Niles, an analyst at Salomon Smit=
h Barney. Before Skilling left, the broadband reaction had already come out=
 of the stock, he said.=20
""The fundamentals do not justify the stock drop to the magnitude we've seen=
 this year,"" said Lay, noting that second-quarter net income rose 40 percen=
t year over year. ""Enron has performed incredibly well.""=20
Lay said attacks by Gov. Gray Davis and others in California on Enron and o=
ther out-of-state energy companies also dragged the stock down. But Califor=
nia's energy crisis is on the path to resolution and the ""blame game"" has t=
apered off, he said.=20
In a blitz of recent meetings with analysts and fund managers, Lay said Enr=
on would respond to requests for more detailed and segmented financial data=
, but without divulging information that is proprietary or damaging to its =
competitive position.=20
Analysts likely will see some of the new data at the end of the third quart=
er and even more by year's end, Lay said. Whether what's provided satisfies=
 them remains to be seen.=20
""The struggle is it's hard to project Enron earnings,"" said Jeff Dietert, a=
n analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston. ""It's hard to develo=
p metrics that you can use to project their earnings. ... There are still q=
uestions as to how they make their money.""=20
Enron, Coale said, tends to group businesses into one sector so ""that it is=
 difficult to see the trees that make up the forest. We refer to their earn=
ings as a black box.""=20
Investors also harbor fears about Enron's cash flow, said Andre Meade, an a=
nalyst at Commerzbank Securities. He described it as more of misperception =
than a problem, as the cash flow can be ""fairly lumpy"" because of the way E=
nron's trading business operates.=20
When Lay names two Enron executives to join him in the office of the chairm=
an, they will be seen as the probable candidates for chief executive. But o=
ther Enron executives not named to the office also may be on the CEO short =
list, Lay said.=20
It could take as long as two or three years to groom a successor, which wou=
ld also give Wall Street time to become comfortable with the person.=20
Names bandied about on Wall Street as possible successors included Mark Fre=
vert, CEO of Enron Wholesale Services; Lawrence ""Greg"" Whalley, chief opera=
ting officer of Enron Wholesale Services; and Dave Delainey, CEO of Enron E=
nergy Services.=20
Enron is also working to resolve the disputes surrounding its Dabhol power =
project in India.=20
Enron holds a 65 percent stake in the project, which it's seeking to sell. =
But Enron says any deal must allow it to recover its approximately $1 billi=
on in costs, which include $875 million of equity investment and unpaid bil=
ls for power the plant has supplied.=20
Lay also expects to announce some large asset sales in the next 12 to 18 mo=
nths.=20
Enron plans to stay on its current strategic path, which includes broadenin=
g its trading into a range of other commodities.=20
""We're just going to keep doing what we're doing,"" Lay said. ""The most impo=

Kim, Kelli and Jeff -

I have taken a look at the Northern California Power Agency deal, and it looks pretty good from a credit standpoint.  We currently have some exposure to NCPA on the power side, but it rolls off by the end of the year, so I think that we can still get this deal done.  Some outstanding issues:

1.  We MUST have a Master Firm in place with NCPA to transact on this deal.  I can begin working on this, but I need to get NCPA's latest financial results to determine an appropriate collateral threshold for NCPA.  This shouldn't be a huge hurdle.

2.  We need to ask Jeff Hodge for his opinion with respect to NCPA transacting a deal of this tenor.  There are sometimes tenor limits placed on municipal entities to limit the term under which they are authorized to transact.  Jeff:  How do we research this issue?  NCPA has provided us a brief statement that indicates that ""NCPA will work expeditiously to execute a definitive contract and has all the necessary approval authorities"", but my feeling is that we need something a little more substantial than that.

3.  Kelli:  Have you spoken with Global Finance to price the embedded loan in this deal?

4.  Kim:  I don't think a credit reserve will be needed on this deal.

5.  Kim:  From the document that NCPA sent out, it appears that your Monday bid is preliminary and conditional.  We need to make sure that NCPA understands our requirements with respect to executing a Master.  Can your contact at NCPA help me get a copy of their latest financials so we can expedite that process?

6.  Kim:  ONE VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:  NCPA's credit ratings have remained solid throughout the California power crisis, for a number of reasons.  As such, I am pretty comfortable moving forward with this deal, given the above requirements.  However, if their financial results indicate some problems, we may need to include some stringent credit requirements in the Master.  I'm pretty sure that their results will look good, but this is a contingency to bear in mind as your prepare your bid.


Please give me a call with any questions.  Thanks,


JRW "

Mr. McConnell,

I am an Energy Management major at OU who is interning here at Enron.  My 
work experience so far has been excellent, and nothing less than what I had 
hoped for.  I have had the opportunity to hear you speak a few times in 
Norman and have been very impressed.  I have been impressed by the things you 
said about this company and its ideals, programs and its commitment to 
excellence - all of which I have seen since I started work.  The most 
impressive thing to me, however, were the things you said about positive 
thinking, goal setting, and the power of the subconscious mind in your talk 
with the J.C. Penney Leadership Program.  These are beliefs which I have been 
raised on by my father, and really believe to be true.  It was very 
inspirational to hear that type of message from someone else for whom it has 
obviously worked.  As I have started my internship here, I am implementing 
this psychology into my life and work ethic, and thought you would might have 
some helpful advice.  I know you are an extremely busy man, but I decided to 
send you an email and ask if you ever had a few free minutes in which I could 
speak with you about how this way of thinking has positively impacted your 
career.  If you ever have a few minutes of free time this summer, I would 
really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you.

Thank you for your time

Blake Lasuzzo

Thanks

Well...  I am back and checking in with you.

Several things:

1)	Russell's mom passed away on Friday.  Funeral is tomorrow (Tuesday) at 4:00 p.m. in Lubbock, Texas.  I am trying to make arrangements to attend, but it doesn't look probable due to flights.

2)	I want your input on canceling the NY trip.  I appreciate your support in letting me proceed to this point.  The remaining benefit was to get everyone together with you to calm the nerves and set a course.  I understand you will not be able to attend.  It seems there is a general public belief (from PEC & Keyspan) that many Enron employees will not have a job after this week.  If they believe that, it is entirely inappropriate to be doing anything celebratory or we will be deemed as ruthless.  I want to make this call immediately.  We have only spent an incremental $500.00 in the reviving of this event.

3)	Per my e-mail on 11/16, I want to ensure that ENA retains Deirdre McCaffrey who is currently in the freight group.  Can we please move her into my group?

4)	A small investment firm has approached us with an inquiry into enovate.  They want us to sign a confidentiality to discuss further.  Your thoughts...

5)	Per our conversation last week, I have not received any package at my home.

5)	Is there anything productive I can do to help you?

Laura"

I need your expertise.  If ENA nominated this gas, and I think we did based on what I see in Unify, then we are supposed to pay for it.  So I just need to verify with you  we TOOK this gas by nominating it.

Deal 1143983 on Natural Gas Pipeline Company.

thanks

I contacted Mary Ellenberger.  She indicated we did receive the gas but have not paid.  I suggested that she contact you via email.

Have we determined if the facts in the letter are correct?  I've confirmed that if the facts are true, the payment needs to be made.

All I need to know is if ENA received the gas as stated, and if there are any extenuating circumstances which would keep us from paying.  Otherwise I believe we need to make payments in accordance with the terms of the deal.  I'll confirm.

Attached is a demand letter w/ short time fuse.  Counterparty wants payment for post-petition gas delivered to Enron.  Please advise if you need commercial involvement.  Thanks

Hi Everyone,
Mark your calendars for Tasters next Thursday (Nov 16th)!!!! Julianna and I
thought it would be fun for us to meet at Downing Street around 9:45 or 10,
for drinks instead of going to dinner!  How does that sound to everyone?
Love, Ashlea"
