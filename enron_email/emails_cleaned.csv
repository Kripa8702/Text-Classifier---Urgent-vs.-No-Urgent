The question to you is in the lastparagraph.Regards,JaniceEB3861Assistant General Counsel, Enron North America Corp.Janice R MooreSager/HOU/ECT@ECTRecapping our call w/ Keith Simmons (TEPAC's outside counsel) this afternoon,we still have the following issues to resolve (the first three are the mostimportant to TEPAC).(1)  Subrogation against TVA -- Keith doubts that TEPAC would ever agree toSection 4.5, despite our expressed need to be able to challenge TVA directlyon its cut of energy we attempt to deliver or its calculation of ReplacementCosts.  Keith suggested that Jason and Phil speak directly to Larry Hamiltonabout this subject, and they will attempt to do that soon.(2)  Mitigation Duty --  They are not comfortable w/ a duty to mitigateReplacement Cost damages that are calculated by TVA b/c they cannot foreseecircumstances where any action or failure to act could have any impact onthose damages.  We explained that we wanted the Distributors to have everyincentive to cooperate w/ us in keeping those damages minimized.  They mightbe willing to concede on this point if we can work out everything else.(3)  EPMI's Cover Damages --  They are not very comfortable agreeing to theconcept that a Distributor would have to pay damages to EPMI b/c they cannotimagine how they could be responsible for failing to receive an ""into""product such as this.  We both agreed to reconsider this.(4)  Criteria for Enron's rejection of Distributor -- Our right to approveDistributors is ok, but they want to add language to prevent EPMI from beingarbitrary about those approvals.  We agreed.(5)  Notice of changes to underlying agreements -- Their duty to notify us itok, but they want to add language that is in line w/ their Distributoragreements, which don't absolutely require Distributors to tell TEPACeverything.  We agreed.(6)  Request for offers --  They would prefer that EPMI call them every dayw/ quotes (which is how Williams does it now), rather than having to initiatethe process.  We described this as our normal way of doing business and theyagreed.(7)  Indemnity clause -- We struck a sentence about each party indemnifyingthe other while they have title to the power, which had been included in ourearlier draft.  I agreed to look into this.(8)  Governing Law and Arbitration -- TEPAC is ok w/ NY law, but would preferincluding a clause requiring EPMI to sue TEPAC or any distributor inTennessee (even tho Keith thinks that would be the legal result anyway).They would also prefer to have the arbitration situs in Tennessee.

"marybeth@monm.edu, rgiese@monm.edu, dick@monm.edumarybeth@monm.edu, rgiese@monm.edu, dick@monm.eduA Summary of the Written Comments from our Members andA Couple of Faculty MembersGeneral Educationmake sense, as long as it is an integrated, coherent and distinctiveprogram. The relation between the general education and majors needs to beexamined and an authoritative body should be charged with the responsibilityof continuously reviewing all programs and the curriculum. There is asuggestion that Sophomore and Junior level Seminars should be introduced.According to our catalog (p. 16), the requirements of a Monmouth College1. Four years of academic work earning at least 124 semester hours.2. Completion of Freshman Seminar3. Completion of a major program, and4. Completion of the five components of the generalBeauty and Meaning in the Works of Art, Human Societies, and Issues andIdeas.One comment is that the present rubric scheme is woefully inadequate to theunderstanding of the Self for which we need to address metaphysical issues,epistemological questions, and issues of God, spirit and man.Freshman SeminarMonmouth College introduced this course in the early eighties and severalschools have added similar courses to their curriculum in subsequent years.There seems to be a strong commitment among the faculty and administrationto continue to develop and teach this course. The following are some of the1.  It is very resource intensive, is trying to do too many things in onesemester, and is quite regimented in its organization and delivery.Instructors need some flexibility after establishment of clear, limited andcommon goals for the course.2.  We should commit more resources to this venture and a greater proportionof senior faculty should teach this course.3.  More stipends and/or release times are needed for the faculty tocontinue the development of this course and to provide shadowing experienceto new faculty members who are interested in teaching it.LanguageThis component generally makes sense - keep, strengthen and change it. Thereis a suggestion to reduce the foreign language requirement and to introducemore courses on foreign cultures and traditions.There is an almost universal agreement that our graduates need moreexperience in writing, in its several forms, composition, creative writing,technical writing etc. We think our task force needs to examine carefully(possibly with a consultant) the concept of Awriting across the curriculum@and find ways of incorporating it in our academic program.  There is also asuggestion that we should require composition courses at the Junior andSenior levels.Beauty and Meaning in the Works of ArtThis component seems to work well. There is a call for a wider range ofchoice of courses in this rubric. Perhaps, we should consider some courseson aesthetics.Physical Universe and its Life FormsThis component also seems to be working well. The assessment of this rubriclast semester did not call for any radical changes. The Assessment Committeeis satisfied with the goals, concept and delivery of this component. Somequestions were raised on the understanding of the scientific method by ourstudents.Scientific literacy is very important in this technological age. Do studentsunderstand the relation between science and technology? There is a call forcourses on History or Philosophy of Science and Science & Society offered byHT folks.Human SocietiesThere is much dissatisfaction with the menu of courses offered beyondComparative Societies. This smorgasbord of courses can be replaced by aslate of 5 to 7 courses, with multiple sections, which address spiritualityin different ways. Another suggestion is to limit this menu to a set ofIntroduction to Social Sciences courses and to make Comparative Societiesvalue-based. It should be noted that our assessment program indicates thatour fifth purpose of exploring Athe spiritual dimension of human existenceand the relationship between faith and knowledge@ is not being addressed byour academic curriculum.Issues and IdeasThis course is supposed to provide the culminating experience in our generaleducation program. It seems to be working well. Can we develop some commongoals for the 15 to 20 courses offered under this rubric? Should we go backto the two-course Systems of Thought and Belief mode?MajorsWe should plan to review all the current majors. We should strive to providea state of the art emphasis in most majors (eg. Molecular Biology,Computational Dimension in Natural Sciences, Media Concentration, PublicRelations, Sports Management etc.) According to AAC&U, there is a Amuddle inthe middle@ in most major programs. Is there coherence and integrationwithin the disciplines? How do the majors relate to the general education?We are expected to make recommendations for adding, modifying, andeliminating course offerings and programs. May be, when more majors becomeattractive and cutting edge, they will stem the tide towards Business andEducation!Further Suggestions1.  There is wide support for introducing a Quantitative Reasoningrequirement in our curriculum. There is a relevant article in our redfolder. We may have to look at Abest practices@ in peer institutions andwork with a regional consultant to see how this can be implemented.2.  How do we educate our students to make value-based decisions in thisfast-changing and complex world? Many schools have introduced EthicalInquiry/Moral Reasoning requirement in their curriculum. There are tworelevant articles in our red folder. Again, we may want to look at Abestpractices@ in peer institutions or work with a regional consultant to seehow this can be implemented.3. We need to introduce course requirements under the broad category ofInternationalization, Globalization and Cultural Diversity in ourcurriculum.4. Do we need to develop courses that explicitly deal with Modes of Inquiry,Critical Thinking, Logical Reasoning, Problem Solving etc.?Other General Considerations Related to Curricular Review1.  The six questions Dean Arnold has raised on the articulation of ourcurricular goals, understanding the needs of our students and the world theyare entering into and the allocation of resources.2.  The implications of the Teagle grant - Adoing nothing is not a viableoption@ and if we come up with strong initiatives, management support may beforthcoming.3.  Simplify the process for curricular initiatives, streamline the budgetprocess and review our style of management.4.  There is no ongoing support for Instruction Technology and our currentpolicies and procedures continue to frustrate folks, especially some of ournewer faculty.5. Our semester schedule is anathema to aims of a serious, liberal artsfreneticism, hyperactivity and resentment.5.  We need to continue to address the work load issue.",,dkdavis@monm.edu,Attachment to Curricular Review Task Force Report 3,True

"david.wall@enron.comdavid.wall@enron.comIt will mean doing the paperwork all over again and closing the old account assuming ECTEF does not want an account.  This is not a name change but actually a transfer from one entity to another.  It will likely require resolutions to open brokerage accounts for ECTMI if they don't already have them in place.Aside from looking foolish to Bear I anticipate no hassles from them.  As far as our side it would be wise to have legal give their estimation of the effort and time frame needed to duplicate the effort that was made for ECTMI.Sara how feasible would it be to prepare account paperwork for the ECTMI company to obtain a Bear account?Thanks,Tom.I will investigate getting an accounting entity set up for ECTMI - does anyone know the number?in the meantime (and don't shout at me Tom) how easy would it be to change the ECTEFbroker account to have a new name - see company below.We must move Anker as a matter of urgency.  Let's discuss.Thanks.After speaking with David Wall about which entity the Anker debt and equity should be moved to, I placed a few quick phone calls.  I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.

First, the effective date of the suspension has been changed fromSeptember 1, 2001 to July 1, 2001 (as proposed in the draft mailed June 15,2001). Second, the draft decision clarifies that customers who have executeddirect access contracts prior to July 1, 2001 may continue to receive powerfrom electric service providers for the initial term of the contracts.Several other editorial and explanatory changes have also been made.Assembly Bill No. 1 from the First Extraordinary Session (AB1X) requiresthat direct access be suspended until the Department of Water Resources nolonger supplies power to the customers of the three largest regulatedelectricity companies. It directs that the Commission determine theeffective date of the suspension. In order to reduce the possibility of harm(1) whether AB1X suspends the entire direct access program, including alltransactions under that program, (2) how the Commission can comply with AB1Xif it exempts written contracts for direct access executed before July 1,2001 from the suspension, and (3) whether July 1, 2001 is an appropriatedate for the suspension......Comments on the draft decision are permitted.Those comments are to be electronically served on the service list (for""The Legislature has directed this Commission to suspend direct access untilDWR no longer procures power for the retail end-users, and we find it shouldbe suspended effective July 1, 2001.  The Legislative direction is clear;and the suspension should apply to SCE, Pacific Gas and Electric Company(PG&E), and San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E).  In the interest ofproviding cost stability for current direct access customers, writtencontracts for direct access signed before July 1, 2001 are exempt from thesuspension for the initial term of the contracts.""""In comments on the draft decision, several parties questioned the need forthe Commission to implement the legislative suspension of direct access assoon as July 1, 2001.  By the draft decision mailed for comment to theparties on June 15, 2001, market participants were provided notice thatdirect access would be suspended as of July 1, 2001.  The Commissionpostponed its consideration of the draft decision.  However, we do notchange the effective date of the suspension.  The underlying legislation wasintroduced on January 3, 2001, enrolled and sent to the Governor on February1, 2001, and signed by the Governor the same day.  Market participants havenow had eight months since then to prepare for this event.  We do not wishto reward customers who have switched to direct access since July 1, 2001 inthe hope that we would change the effective date of the suspension when thisswitch could disadvantage customers who continue to receive bundled servicefrom the utility.""The decision also states that no parties have raised any factual issueswhich would justify hearings, which presumably, although not explicitly,disposes of the joint AReM/WPTF filing.

In North America, natural-gas volumes jumped 9% andelectricity-trading volumes jumped 71%. In Europe, where Enron is pushingaggressively into newly deregulated markets, trading volumes for gas morethan doubled and for electricity leapt to almost five times those of before.From practically nothing just two years ago, Europe generates one-quarter ofEnron's energy-trading volumes.Profits from trading more than compensated for a $101 million loss posted forthe company's telecommunications business that analysts had, until recently,proclaimed would soon generate more income than Enron's energy business. Forthe quarter, bandwidth-service revenue was $16 million. The unit posted aloss of $8 million for the year-earlier quarter.Enron's chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling, said prices for capacity onfiber-optic networks, such as the one Enron has built, have been ""droppinglike a rock. . . . We've been shocked at the extent.""Mr. Skilling said the company is trying to boost revenue by focusing onfiber-optic delivery of data and entertainment -- ""a narrow piece of thebusiness but about all that's left"" -- and is hoping the glut in capacitywill evaporate as competitors go broke. He said companies that continue toinvest, despite the ""market meltdown,"" and keep their networks state of theart will be rewarded eventually.Enron's results beat analysts' expectations, but several said they fearsoftening electricity prices throughout the nation, and particularly in theWest, could crimp third-quarter results. ""Enron benefited from unusual pricevolatility,"" during the quarter, said Raymond Niles, an energy analyst forSalomon Smith Barney. But it is uncertain whether that will continue with ageneral softening of natural-gas and electricity prices across the country,most notably in the West.Mr. Skilling said he thinks California may have seen the worst of its energycrisis. He consistently has said he doesn't think Enron's earnings will besignificantly affected by possible refund orders from federal energyregulators or other regulatory intervention.He added that Enron was pleased with steps the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission took this week to encourage the formation of four bigelectric-transmission grid operators in the West, the Northeast, theSoutheast and the Midwest.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Business/Financial Desk; Section CEnron Net Rose 40% in QuarterBloomberg News07/13/2001The New York TimesPage 12, Column 4c. 2001 New York Times CompanyHOUSTON, July 12 -- The Enron Corporation, an energy trader, said today thatits second-quarter profit rose 40 percent as its sales of natural gas andelectricity surged in the United States and Europe.Net income rose to $404 million, or 45 cents a share, from $289 million, or34 cents, in the period a year ago, Enron said. Results beat analysts'estimates by 3 cents a share.Revenue almost tripled to $50.1 billion. Enron, which is based in Houston,sold almost twice as much power in North America and five times as much inEurope than in the quarter a year ago.Although electricity and natural gas prices surged in California, Jeffrey K.Skilling, the chief executive of Enron, said the state ''is just not a bigfactor'' in Enron's increasing profits. The company bolsters earnings byincreasing sales of energy and other commodities like lumber and steel ratherthan by raising prices, analysts said.''That's the nature of the commodities business,'' said Zach Wagner, ananalyst with Edward Jones & Company. ''As markets open up, their volumes willgrow. Their margins are basically flat.''Enron's profit margin was less than 1 percent last year and has averaged 2.1percent the last five years, based on Bloomberg data. That compares with aprofit margin of 6.5 percent for Exxon Mobil, the largest publicly tradedenergy company.Shares of Enron have dropped 31 percent the last year, despite steadilyincreasing earnings, and sales that now rival those of Exxon Mobil. Shares ofEnron rose 45 cents today, to $49.55.Enron was expected to make 42 cents a share in the quarter, the averageestimate of analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

""Argentina is keeping a good bid in the [Treasury] market,"" said PeterCordrey, managing director at Prudential Investment Management in New Jersey.Much of the focus again was Argentina, whose long-term sovereign creditrating yesterday was cut by Standard & Poor's to single-B-minus fromsingle-B.S&P said the ratings outlook for Argentina remained negative and cited""growing strain on the cohesion of the governing coalition and the risk thatit may impede efforts by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo to implementdraconian measures to balance the federal budget.""That country is ""just looking worse and worse every time you turn around,""said Drew Matus, market economist with Lehman Brothers in New York.Despite indications that Argentine officials are trying to win agreement onspending cuts, investors remained nervous about the nation's ability toservice its large external debt burden. Prices of Argentine floating-ratebonds fell about 103/8 points to 623/8.In U.S. Treasury trading, meanwhile, the benchmark 10-year note at 4 p.m. EDTwas up 8/32 point, or $2.50 per $1,000 face value, at 98 6/32. Its yield fellto 5.242% from 5.276% late Wednesday, as yields move inversely to prices.The 30-year Treasury bond's price was up 14/32 at 96 1/32 to yield 5.652%,down from 5.684% Wednesday.Shorter Treasury maturities preformed less strongly than longer ones, andanalysts cited gains in stocks as a reason.The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 237.97 points to 10478.99, and theNasdaq Composite Index jumped 103.70 points to 2,075.74. Treasurys are being""pulled in two directions, and the stock market is winning in the [short]end,"" said Richard Gilhooly, senior bond strategist at Paribas CapitalMarkets in New York.Another factor bolstering Treasurys was economic news. In two early releases,the Labor Department reported both a huge rise in claims for stateunemployment benefits and slightly lower prices for imported goods.The number of workers filing first-time applications for jobless benefitsjumped by 42,000 to 445,000 in the week ended July 7, the highest level sinceabout mid-1992. That raised the four-week moving average to 410,750 claims.Today, two other economic reports may dominate the attention of bondA Dow Jones Newswires/CNBC survey found that economists believe the PPI wasunchanged in June and will show a slight 0.1% increase in the month excludingfood and energy. ""The friendly inflation news should help to keep a bid inlong [dated] Treasurys,"" said Gemma Wright, a bond-market strategist atBarclays Capital in New York.A separate Dow Jones Newswires poll found that economists expect to see a0.3% rise in overall retail sales in June, or a 0.2% sales gain excludingautomobiles.Corporate BondsMarlin Water Trust II sold $475 million and 515 million euros ($439 million)of securities via Credit Suisse First Boston and Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.In 1998, Enron Corp. created a special-purpose entity, to finance thepurchase of water utility Wessex Water PLC of the United Kingdom. Yesterday'sissue was a refinancing of that debt, but was done in a way that keeps thedebt off Enron's balance sheet, underwriting officials said.The U.S. portion of the deal was priced to yield 6.31%, or 2.25 percentagepoints over Treasurys. In early trading, it was quoted at 2.25 percentagepoints over Treasurys, which was ""reasonably positive on a day when thecorporate market was so jittery,"" said Stephen Kane, portfolio manager atMetropolitan West Asset Management.Generally, investment-grade corporate bonds weakened on concerns aboutemerging markets. Yield margins to Treasurys, an important performance gauge,widened by 0.05 to 0.10 percentage point.Separately, Citigroup Inc. tapped the market with $2 billion of two-yearglobal floating-rate notes priced to yield 0.09 percentage point overthree-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor.Agency SecuritiesFannie Mae sold $2.5 billion of callable benchmark securities, which tradedstrongly afterward.Its $1.5 billion of 5.5%, five-year notes yielded 5.5657%, or 0.05 percentagepoint over the Fannie Mae benchmark level on an option-adjusted spread basis.An additional $1 billion of 6.25%, 10-year notes yielded 6.408%, or 0.03percentage point over the Fannie Mae benchmark level on an option-adjustedbasis.Scott Graham, head of agency trading at Greenwich Capital Markets, said hiscompany saw ""a number of customers"" who don't typically consider callableissues, but were nonetheless looking to buy some of the new securities.---Sonja Ryst, Richard A.

GOP officialsclaim credit for forcing the disclosure of potential conflict.ERIC BAILEYTIMES STAFF WRITER07/13/2001Los Angeles TimesHome EditionB-10Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror CompanySACRAMENTO -- More than half a dozen consultants hired by the state topurchase electricity and to negotiate long-term power deals own stock ingenerating companies such as Calpine and Enron that have profited handsomelyduring California's energy crisis.The potential conflict of interest emerged Thursday with the release offinancial disclosure statements by consultants who have been hired by thestate since the start of the power crunch.Among those disclosing stock ownership were two key negotiators of long-termenergy contracts and two workers hired to purchase electricity fromgenerators, including some of the firms in which they hold an interest.Several other consultants who played key roles in the state's energy effortsdecided not to file financial disclosure statements, citing legal exemptionsunder state law.Among those who did not file the financial disclosure statements were a pairof executives at two Wall Street firms that stand to make $14 million if thestate buys California's power grid. Of about 50 consultants hired by thestate in the past six months, 27 filed the disclosures.The disclosures follow a firestorm in Sacramento last month over the hiringby Gov. Gray Davis of two media consultants also employed by SouthernCalifornia Edison, the troubled utility that is negotiating with the stateover a bailout package.Steve Maviglio, a Davis spokesman, said the governor's legal staff wasreviewing the financial disclosure forms for any potential conflicts ofinterest.""If there's anything inappropriate,"" Maviglio said, ""then we'll deal withit.""Republicans, however, said the hired workers had revealed overt conflictsthat clearly violated state law.Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican running for governor againstDavis next year, said the revelations call into question the work performedby the consultants on high-priced energy contracts that are ""going tomortgage our children's future for decades to come.""""If you show a conflict, the potential is there for collusion,"" Jones said.""I'm not accusing anyone, but that's why you have disclosure.""Rob Stutzman, a state GOP spokesman, said he was particularly troubledbecause the consultants had delayed filing the disclosure forms for months.Under state law, the forms are supposed to be submitted within 30 days afterthe consultants go to work for the state.Most of the energy consultants, who could not be reached for comment,reported owning relatively small amounts of stock in energy firms, generallyless than $10,000.But one of the new workers, William Mead, disclosed that he owned between$100,000 and$1 million in Calpine, a San Jose-based energy firm. Mead did notreport when the stock had been purchased.Only one of the contractors reported selling off stock after coming to workfor the state.Vikram Budhraja, president of Pasadena-based Electric Power Group LLC, onJan. 11 purchased between $10,000 and $100,000 in stock of Dynegy, aelectricity and natural gas producer. He sold it off on Jan. 29, 10 daysafter he came to work for the state. Budhraja has been a top negotiator ofthe state's long-term energy contracts, which have included a deal concludedMarch 2 with Dynegy.Richard Ferreira, a retired Sacramento Utility District executive hired bythe state to negotiate long-term power contracts, reported the purchase ofbetween $2,000 and $10,000 of stock in Calpine, a San Jose-based energy firm,in August 2000. He also purchased a similar amount of stock in GeneralElectric Co., which produces power plant equipment, in April 2000.Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, reported that he owned an undisclosedamount of stock in Enron Corp., a big Texas-based energy firm. Elaine Griffinpurchased between $10,000 and $100,000 in Calpine stock on Feb. 1, less thanthree weeks before she came to work for the state as an energy trader.Constantine Louie, an energy scheduler, reported owning between $10,000 and$100,000 in Calpine stock.Republicans took credit for forcing the Davis administration to file thereports, a charge the governor's office brushed aside.Jones, the secretary of state, held a news conference Tuesday to complainabout the failure of nearly all the state's energy consultants to file anysort of financial disclosure forms. The statements were only made availablelate in the afternoon Thursday, months after many consultants went to workfor the state.Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said the delays were explained in part bynegotiations that began in March with the Fair Political PracticesCommission, the state's ethics watchdog, to determine if the consultants wererequired to file the forms.He also suggested that Jones' accusations were fueled more by campaignpolitics than any devotion to constitutional duty.""One needs to question why the secretary of state is using taxpayer money toinvestigate something beyond his jurisdiction,"" Maviglio said. ""That's why wehave an FPPC, to look at these kinds of things.""Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Gray Davis in insisting that theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission order the refunds of alleged overcharges.Senate Democrats set the high target despite a federal mediator's rulingagainst Davis earlier this week. The mediator said California would beentitled to only about $1 billion in generator overcharges, not the $8.9billion that Davis has fought for.Senate officers said the cost of the mail campaign will be paid from thebudgets of senators, at taxpayer expense, as part of the Legislature'sconstituent service mail program.But Republicans attacked the mailer as political propaganda that may violatestate law and Senate policy barring issuance of ""partisan"" documents atpublic expense.Sketchy details of the quietly developed project surfaced on the Senate floorThursday. Staffers who worked on it said it was virtually impossible tocalculate the program's cost.But they indicated that if all 26 Democrats agreed to send up to 30,000mailers each to constituents, the postage alone would cost $140,400.If each mass mailing exceeded 30,000 pieces, a higher postage rate wouldapply, raising the cost, officials said.In the mailer, constituents are asked to return an attached card to theirstate senator, urging ""full refunds of the outrageous prices charged by thegreedy out-of-state power generators.""Cynthia Lavagetto, manager of the Senate mail program, said each member willdecide what do do with the returned cards, including simply filing them orsending them on to FERC.Lavagetto said a prototype mailer was prepared with the help of the SelectCommittee on Citizen Participation, a panel that has no chairman or members,since it has not been activated this year. But it does maintain an office andhas three staffers on the Senate payroll.Burton dismissed the Republican charges of partisanship as baseless. ""We dothis all the time on a variety of issues,"" he said. ""We're saying, 'Stopstealing California's money.' ""But Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine, the Senate's senior Republican, denouncedthe mailing as clearly partisan. He said it appeared to reflect a developing2002 election strategy of Davis and Democrats to blame the FERC andout-of-state generators for California's energy mess.""I seriously question the appropriateness of using taxpayer money to getpeople to lobby [for the refunds],"" Johnson said.Johnson and Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside) suggested that Democrats turn theircriticism to municipal utilities, including the Los Angeles Department ofWater and Power. Some utilities charged the state even higher prices lastwinter than did private generators.""Why are they not attacking the DWP?"" Johnson asked.He noted that S. David Freeman was running the DWP at the time some of itshighest prices were charged to the state, which is buying power forCalifornia's financially crippled utilities. Later, Davis hired Freeman ashis top energy price negotiator.""Doesn't David Freeman more properly belong in that same jail cell as the guycalled Spike than he does in the governor's office?"" Johnson asked.""Spike"" has become a character in the California energy debate, thanks toAtty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, who is investigating whether power sellers engagedin price-gouging and antitrust behavior.In an interview with the Wall Street Journal in May, Lockyer said he would""love to personally escort [Enron Corp.

All Rights ReservedEnron, the US energy trader, yesterday posted a 40 per cent rise insecond-quarter profits to $404m, due to surging gas and electricity sales inNorth America and Europe.The Houston-based company also said it would continue to grow aggressively inEurope and seize any opportunities to expand in the US, after regulators onWednesday ordered the formation of an organisation to open the North Americanelectricity market.Jeff Skilling, Enron chief executive, said the company had its sights set onEurope for strong earnings growth, which it hopes will eventually match NorthAmerica.The company's wholesale business unit, the group's main profit driver,derives 70 per cent of its business from North America.""We see more growth opportunity in Europe than in North America. Gas volumesare up more than 100 per cent (in the quarter),"" Mr Skilling said. ""The gasand electric market in Europe is almost as big as North America and we got anearly start.""Mr Skilling said a decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission toorder the formation of four grid organisations to optimise the transmissionof electricity in parts of the US was hugely important.He estimated only 20 per cent of the wholesale market for electricity couldbe accessed and the decision would take this to 90-95 per cent.Mr Skilling said Enron, which has transformed itself from a pipeline companyinto a large energy trader, was focused on its volumes, not revenues, whichjumped to $50.1bn in the quarter, from $16.9bn a year ago.The only poor performer was the broadband division, which trades space onfibre-optic networks. The unit posted a loss of $102m in the quarter, againstan $8m loss a year ago, and the company said it would cut costs there.Enron's result of $404m, or 45 cents a share, compared with $289m, or 34cents, in the same quarter a year ago.Analysts had been expecting 42 cents a share.By the close in New York, the company's shares were trading 45 cents higherto $49.55.

Having enjoyed its status as atelecommunications play last year, Enron is now suffering with its newfriends. The US energy trader has dropped by 40 per cent since the start ofthe year - underperforming the market by a third - despite the earningsmomentum in its core energy trading business.A 40 per cent increase in net income in the second quarter, even allowing forinevitable questions over earnings quality, is impressive. The strength ofthe energy trading business, with volumes up by almost 60 per cent, is morethan enough to offset the misery in the broadband trading business.However, the broadband division's $102m losses are shocking, even in thesedifficult times. The market has collapsed, partly owing to credit problems inthe telecoms sector. Enron's cost base is completely out of kilter with theopportunity. At least it should not be too hard to put that right. Actualinvestment in assets is limited; and by reallocating staff to thefast-growing energy trading divisions, restructuring costs can be kept to aminimum.Broadband is not the only worry. California's troubles have not affectedtrading volumes, but regulatory risk remains, while promises on asset saleshave not been met. Trading on 23 times 2002 forecast earnings, the valuationlooks fair for a fast-growing trading company. The upside lies in convincinginvestors to give the company more credit for its value-added risk managementservices. The long-term potential of broadband trading, meanwhile, is thrownin for free.(c) Copyright Financial Times Group.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.White House adviser targeted for dealings with Salvation ArmyBy RON FOURNIERAP White House Correspondent07/13/2001Associated Press NewswiresCopyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.WASHINGTON (AP) - Senior White House adviser Karl Rove, increasingly a targetof criticism from Democrats and Republicans, wound up at the center of a newstorm over his dealings with the Salvation Army.White House aides rallied to his side, and Rove was unapologetic. ButDemocratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe called forcongressional hearings.""I think the truth needs to come out,"" McAuliffe said Thursday. ""Let's havehearings and get to the bottom of this.""At issue was the Salvation Army's push for a regulation allowing religiouscharities to practice workplace discrimination against gays, and Rove'sactions on behalf of the group. Rove said he was simply doing his job.While McAuliffe called for hearings, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle,D-S.D., seemed less riled. ""Karl Rove is a very respected individual and Iwouldn't have any comment to make,"" Daschle said.Thursday's flap was not the first for Rove, who oversees politics, strategyand public liaison at the White House.When Sen. James Jeffords bolted the GOP and turned the Senate over toDemocrats last month, Republicans accused Rove of alienating the Vermontlawmaker during the tax-cut debate. He was fingered, too, for not warningBush earlier that Jeffords might jump ship.When Rove sat in White House meetings on policy that could impact his stockportfolio, Democrats demanded to know whether his holdings with Houston-basedEnron Corp. and Intel Corp. created a conflict of interest.When Bush crossed some military advisers and suspended Navy bombing on thePuerto Rican island of Vieques, Rove's involvement in the case was held up asproof by critics that the decision was politically-motivated.Rove's involvement in the Salvation Army case has stirred debate inRepublican and Democratic circles about whether he wields too much power andis too political for the White House.The White House rejected the Salvation Army's request Wednesday, but onlyafter the revelation of an embarrassing Salvation Army memo. The memo saidthe administration had promised to issue a regulation protecting it and otherreligious charities from efforts to prevent such discrimination in exchangefor the Salvation Army's support of Bush's plan to open government programsto religious groups.White House officials left the impression that no senior officials wereinvolved in the discussions, failing to point out Rove's activity untilThursday.In a telephone interview, Rove said he recalled having just three or fourbrief discussions on the topic. He received a request from a Salvation Armyally to looked into the rule, sent the ally to the White House faith-basedoffice, forwarded the written request to a government lawyer and was toldlater by the lawyer, ""We're not certain there's anything we can do.""The lawyer, Jay Lefkowitz, told reporters the request lay dormant after hisdiscussion with Rove.Rove rejected the criticism. ""My job is not to say, `Don't send me somethingor call me.' My job is to keep my eyes and ears open and send things to theappropriate departments,"" he said.Some top Republicans outside the White House said Rove has become alightening rod.""Part of his role is to be a deflection shield for the president,"" said GOPconsultant Rich Bond. ""Everytime Karl takes a hit, it's one less hit thepresident has to take. Karl knows that and he is a big boy.""Aides say the president is not troubled by Rove's actions, even joking aboutthe controversies.White House chief of staff Andrew Card also defended Rove.""I may be naive, but we have no problem of division on the senior level,""said Card. ""I was in the Reagan White House when we had three clear camps ...We don't have that here.""Aides do acknowledge, however, that there is some resentment of Rove in thelower ranks of the White House. Some grumbled that Rove did not let WhiteHouse press secretary Ari Fleischer know Wednesday about his involvement inthe Salvation Army case. Others, still tired from a tough campaign andfrustrated by their new jobs, said they resent Rove's wide reach.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.California Power Bills Exceed Refunds, Judge Says (Update4)California Power Bills Exceed Refunds, Judge Says (Update4)(Adds legislator comment in sixth paragraph, details fromjudge in 11th paragraph, negotiator comment in 12th paragraph.)Washington, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- California's debts topower sellers for electricity purchases exceed any refund thestate can claim for alleged overcharging, a judge overseeingsettlement talks said in a report to federal regulators.California and its utilities may be owed more than $1 billionon claims generators overcharged them, Administrative Law JudgeCurtis Wagner wrote in a report to the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission. California alleges power sellers like Duke EnergyCorp., Enron Corp. illegally inflated prices by $8.9 billion.``While there are vast sums due for overcharges, there areeven larger amounts owed to energy sellers'' by California and itsutilities, Wagner wrote. He said the state is owed ``hundreds ofmillions of dollars, probably more than a billion dollars.''The decision strengthens the generators' claim that thestate's request for billions isn't supported by the facts. Energycompanies have offered a total of $716 million in refunds to thestate, Wagner said.FERC-ordered negotiations between the state and the energysellers broke down without an agreement this week. FERC willdecide on the size of refunds within 60 days. California GovernorGray Davis has said the state will sue if it does not receive therefunds it demanded.``I find it unlikely that someone will not be unhappy enoughto go to court,'' said State Senator Debra Bowen, a Democrat fromLos Angeles. ``There's too much money at stake.''Wagner's ReportFERC will use Wagner's report to calculate the size of anyrefunds. California could receive refunds in the form of creditagainst power-buying debts. In his report, Wagner didn't say howmuch the state and its utilities owe to power companies.``Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount isdue the seller? The chief judge thinks not,'' wrote Wagner, who isFERC's chief administrative law judge.Wagner provided suggestions to the FERC commissioners on howto set any refunds. He urged that they calculate potentialovercharges beginning October 2000. California had urged thesettlement be figured from May 2000.Davis criticized that decision, calling it ``a $3 billionfree gouge for the generators'' in a statement released by hisoffice.The judge said California had rejected a settlement offer hemade during the talks. He did not say what that settlement offerwas. He said California would not budge from its initial demand.He also said California did not provide him some of the backgroundinformation he requested until this week.``If we had more time we might have been able to respond morequickly, but we did the best we could,'' said Michael Kahn,chairman of the Independent System Operator, the state's electricgrid manager. He led the state delegation.Heart of DisputeAt the heart of the dispute are federal regulations thatrequire power sellers to charge only those rates deemed by federalregulators to be ``just and reasonable.'' FERC had price caps inplace when some of the disputed power purchases were made.Energy companies claim that rising natural-gas prices and alack of adequate supply pushed prices up. The state accuses thecompanies reaping unreasonable profits.Davis has made attacks on power generators a staple of hisresponse to the energy crisis, and has accused them of gouging thestate in dozens of speeches since January. He said that if thestate isn't paid $8.9 billion, it would sue for up to $20 billion.Energy executives accuse Davis and California politicalleaders of attempting to scapegoat the energy companies for afailed deregulation plan that led to soaring wholesale prices lastyear. The state's largest two utilities can't pay for their power.``It's pretty clear that the state has no particular interestin resolving this,'' Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling saidin an interview with Bloomberg News. ``It makes for good politicalfodder, and so I think they'll spend a lot of time making a lot ofnoise about it.''Several other energy companies praised the judge'srecommendations.``We agree with the judge's position that the $8.9 billionrefund number is totally unsubstantiated,'' Duke Energy Corp.spokesman Tom Williams said.PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric and EdisonInternational's Southern California Edison, the state's largestinvestor-owned utilities, ran up more than $14 billion in debtbuying electricity last year. The state stepped in and beganbuying power for them in January, and has spent more than $7billion.California Governor Casts Blame for Crisis, to His BenefitCalifornia Governor Casts Blame for Crisis, to His BenefitSan Francisco, July 13 (Bloomberg) -- California GovernorGray Davis's popularity is bouncing back, and pollsters credit theDemocratic lawmaker's campaign to blame the state's energyproblems on out-of-state power companies.Davis has criticized Duke Energy Corp., Enron Corp. and otherpower sellers as price gougers since January. This week, Davisused a power-plant opening as a platform to claim that energysellers are ``bleeding us dry.'' The Democratic state attorneygeneral and Democratic-controlled state Senate are investigatingthe firms for market manipulation.The governor is winning support because of his attacks. A LosAngeles Times poll in June showed that 86 percent of Californiansbelieved power generators distorted prices. Davis's approvalrating rose to 52 percent of registered voters in June, from 46percent in early April, his lowest since being elected in 1998,his pollster, Paul Maslin, found.``Gray Davis is very good at licking his fingers and seeingwhich way the political winds blow,'' said Bruce Cain, a politicalscience professor at the University of California at Berkeley.``And he's found good villains.''Outlook for SettlementThe politics may make it harder for the state to reach asettlement with energy companies for claims they overcharged thestate by $8.9 billion, analysts say. A federal judge overseeingsettlement talks said the state is owed far less. Davis says thestate will sue for $18 billion if its demands aren't met.``There is no way you are going to get any kind of agreementfrom someone making such audacious claims,'' said Donato Eassey,an energy analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. in Houston.The refunds may be secondary to Davis's effort to be re-elected in 2002, a victory that political analysts say positionhim as a contender for national office in 2004.``He's in good shape going into 2002, and if he wins, there'sthe inevitable speculation about whether he eyes a run forpresident in 2004,'' Cain said.Just months ago, Davis's public approval ratings were attheir lowest point since he was elected, according to a FieldInstitute poll in April.PG&E Corp.'s utility, the state's largest, was in bankruptcy.Wholesale-power prices were rising, and millions of Californianslost power in a string of blackouts caused by reduced powerreserves.Governor ReboundsThe governor was widely criticized for failing to act swiftlyto end the crisis. Now Davis seems to be recovering, analystssaid.While vilifying the power companies, the first-term governorhas also been spearheading the state's response to the energycrisis. He has created a team to negotiate a financial rescuepackage to save Edison International's Southern California Edisonutility from bankruptcy, started an $800 energy conservation driveand pushed for more power plants to be built.The energy companies lashed back at Davis this week. Aspokesman for Enron Corp., the world's largest energy trader,accused Davis and California leaders of conducting a political``witch hunt.''``The last thing they want to do is take responsibility forthe problem they created,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.``They set about looking for the biggest villains.''Enron filed suit against a California state Senate committeeinvestigating allegations of market manipulation, accusing thepanel and its Democratic chairman in a letter of seeking a``scapegoat'' for a failed deregulation law.Plotting his ResponseDavis began plotting his response to the crisis almostimmediately after it became public in January, said Garry South,his chief political strategist. Step one, Davis aides said, was toblame the energy companies that were profiting from the state'swoes. Davis targeted a half-dozen companies. In addition to Enronand Duke, Mirant Corp., Reliant Energy Inc., and Williams Cos.were placed in the crosshairs.``There was a group of perpetrators from out of statemanipulating this system and screwing consumers,'' South said.``We had to explain how this thing happened.''Republicans criticize Davis for inaction on the crisis, whileacknowledging he is favored to win re-election going into nextyear's campaign.He leads three potential rivals -- Secretary of State BillJones, banker William Simon, the son of former Treasury SecretaryWilliam Simon, and former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan,according to the Times poll of 1,541 state residents conductedJune 23-26.``He will be the favorite,'' said Rob Stutzman, a consultantfor the California Republican Party.Worries AheadDavis still has worries as the state struggles to address theenergy crisis, analysts say.PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy inApril. Edison International's Southern California Edison, the No.2 utility, is struggling to overcome legislative opposition to thefinancial-rescue package negotiated by Davis.Davis may be blamed, analysts say, if the state Legislaturerefuses to ratify the rescue plan for Edison and the utility filesfor bankruptcy. Republicans and many Democrats in the Legislatureoppose the agreement, known as a memorandum of understanding.``The MOU's dead, and the likely scenario is for the utilityis to go into bankruptcy,'' said Peter Navarro, an associateprofessor of economics and public management at the University ofCalifornia at Irvine.California voters may receive unpleasant reminders of thecrisis all summer. The state has already suffered through six daysof rolling blackouts, and more are predicted.``As soon as the lights go out, it's Gray's fault,'' Navarrosaid.",,ann.schmidt@enron.com,Enron Mentions,True

"tanya.rohauer@enron.comtanya.rohauer@enron.comWhy don't we file a lawsuit in state district court in Houston, serve them,and wait for their counsel to appear or take a default. We need to force themto respond. Let me know what you think.Britt Davis@ENRONRohauer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Russell Diamond/HOU/ECT@ECTAndy,This is basically a collection action for about $1,800,000 of unpaid spot gassales against Triad, a very small company whose address (or at least oneaddress) is in Columbus, Maryland.   The unpaid sales deals began aroundFebruary of 2000.  All the deals were made over the phone by the trader, andthen confirmed with ENA's spot gas sales forms (""confirms"").  Per ENA's usualcustom and practice, neither ENA nor Triad signed the confirms, althoughthere are signature lines.  ENA scheduled the gas due for all of thesedeals.  Triad paid off some other deals, but has since stopped sending us anymoney.  I am told that the deals that are unpaid began in late February2000.  Triad's principal, Sherwood Purnell, has apparently admitted in arecorded telephone conference that he would pay us.  Our information is thatTriad is financially unable to pay us or anyone else.Per the mandatory arbitration language in the confirms, we have sent anarbitration demand to Triad.  Triad did not respond.  The AAA has sent out alist of arbitrators from which the parties are to make selections by February7.  I have called a telephone number which gives a recording for Triad and anextension for Purnell, and left a message that I want to discuss the case.This was on Monday.  I have also had  Becky, my legal assistant, call upTriad's registered agent for service of process, although the Marylandsecretary of state's office shows that Triad is no longer in good standing.The person whose name is listed as the registered agent answered and toldBecky (a) he was still the right party to receive service of process and (b)he was ""aware of us"".  This leads me to believe that the address that we havebeen using is a good address.  We did get someone to sign for documents thatwe sent to that address.What I don't want to do, however,  is go all the way through arbitration, geta default judgment, then, when we try to enforce it, have Triad complain thatwe sent the demand and the pleadings to the wrong address.My plan is to ask the AAA for a fifteen-day extension of time within which tosend our demand and other relevant pleadings to the registered agent and anyother address that looks viable, by Federal Express or certified mail, sothat we get a receipt.  So long as we get the registered agent to sign forthese things, I feel a lot more comfortable about proceeding.   Giving Triadan extension of time to answer also makes us look good.Parenthetically, unfortunately, given Triad's attitude, I think it likelythat after we get an arbitration award, Triad will choose not to abide by ituntil, at a minimum, we file a lawsuit in Maryland to have the awardenforced.  I don't see a way around that problem.Let me know if it is okay to ask for the extension of time.BrittThanks.Britt",britt.davis@enron.com,richard.sanders@enron.com,ENA v. Triad,True

The agreement has been signed, is legallybinding, can not be unilaterally terminated by LG and transfer of money willtake an additional $3.55 MM gain, or $11.8 MM aggregate, if we chose toexercise our option to invest $4.5 MM in DAC prior to year end)Encorp ($14.1 MM) - Encorp has received a term sheet from Ballentine Capitalwhich values the company at $100 MM pre-money.  Beacon Capital and GoldmanSachs have both passed on making an investment at $100 MM.  Given currentmarket conditions, we believe a pre-money valuation of $90 MM is morerealistic and closer to what Ballentine will ultimately do the deal at.  The$14.1 MM figure corresponds to a valuation of $90 MM.Solo Energy ($1.5 MM) - the downturn in the equity markets has had its effecton Solo's fund raising.  Chase H&Q has solicited a number of investors in themarket, including Beacon, Perseus, Stephens (Little Rock) and Ballentine andall are interested and reviewing.  Charlie's sense is that the term sheetsthat we should receive by year end will be at a valuation lower than the $80MM that H&Q has been advertising to the company (and us).  The $1.5 MM figurecorresponds to a pre-money valuation of $60 MM, which we view as morerealistic.Metering Technology Corp. ($1.0 MM) - Aqua International Partners has agreedto invest $15 MM at a pre-money valuation of $45 MM.Power Systems Mfg LLC ($0.72 MM) - the principals of PSM have agreed to sellthe company to Calpine for $43 MM, making our warrant worth $1.72 MM.  Enronwill receive cash for the warrant upon closing of the deal.  PSM's proceedswill be paid out over a 2-3 year period.Utiliquest - we learned in November that Utiliquest had lost its bid toretain the Atlanta area locating business of BellSouth, Atlanta Gas & Light,Metromedia (Cable TV) and Georgia Power.  This was obviously disappointing tous - and symptomatic of the performance which led me to replace Utiliquest'sCEO just prior to the award of Atlanta bid (which went to STS, a subsidiaryof Dycom).  The initial indication from the company was that - while Atlantarepresented $20 MM in revenues (roughly 20% of total revenues) - there wouldbe a proportionately smaller change in EBITDA and the bottom line.  Afterfurther analysis - conducted in connection with our planned divestiture - wehave determined that there will likely be a $2-3 MM reduction in EBITDA for2000.  Our anticipated EBITDA exit multiple is 6-7x 2000 figures.  I need todiscuss a revaluation of Utiliquest in more detail with Kevin, Wes Colwelland Andrea Reed.Total comes to $25.6 MM plus whatever we determine is achievable onUtiliquest.Please call if you have any questions.MLM","David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff Donahue/HOU/ECT@ECT",david.delainey@enron.com,4Q Earnings from ENA Principal Investments,False

"Stinson,Do we want to revisit?Vince---------------------- Forwarded by Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 04/24/2000Please respond to ""Martin Jermakyan"" <martin@electrapartners.com>Dear Vince,Attached please find an updated resume of mine.I have been continuing my research in the area of pricing, risk managementand asset management of power industry.  It seems to me that the framework Ihave been working on does allow addressing some fundamental issues andallows describing the salient features of power markets.  I feel a briefinfo may inform you what have I been up to.Conceptually speaking, my approach relies on the understudying that theabsence of cash and carry implies non-hedgibility of the most fundamentalbuilding blocks of power market - forward contracts of hourly duration.This clearly demands a risk premium embedded in power prices.  I have beenable to develop a machinery to capture this risk premium, and calculate itsimpact on pricing of other products.  In particular, the method allowsconsistent generation of hourly forward curve (per each geographic region),hence generation of forward curves of longer duration.  It provides us notonly with forward curves, but also their physical (not risk-neutral)distribution.  It also allows one to analyze the sensitivity of the forwardcurve with respect to the volumetric risk.  As a fundamental  input ,  Iconsider the ratio of properly compounded generation output (load) and thecorresponding maximum available generation supply.  The first one is wellobservable and forecastable due to its stationarity.  The second one  isdefined by the first one and the generation and transmission profile of theregion.  Much of the required information is in the public domain.The market price of risk incorporated in the model depends on this ratio andthe calendar time.  This time dependence of the market price of risk allowscapturing of the dynamics of the returns per unit risk over time, and itsdependence on the ratio mentioned above reflects the intuition and thereality that closer the demand to the maximum available supply highercompensation do the investors expect.I have also realized that the transmission related factors may beincorporated into this framework in a very consistent and robust manner.This approach also allows quantification of the margins as a stochasticprocess dependent on the volumetric factors, among other things.  It allowsposing and solving the problem of maximization of the margins while keepingtheir variance under control in a very elegant and robust way.I have developed the first version of mathematical tools and prototypesoftware reflecting all these issues.  My inability to complete this programhas been resulted from the severe instability, lack of access and the cashflow problems I have experienced in the last few years.  I have alsounderstood that programs of this magnitude cannot be finished from the""grandpa's garage.""Nevertheless, I think I have developed a very systematic and robustunderstanding and methodology, and at least, I have convinced myself thatthis approach leads to a comprehensive system.With all this said, I don't want to make an impression of a stiff person,who has his agenda and under any circumstances is willing to push itforward.  I have always been very flexible, and in my consulting experience,I have always accommodated the needs and wishes on my clients.  In my shortperiod of employment with Altra I have been very ethical, I have played bythe rules, I have done whatever I have been asked to do, and have been ateam player.  The reasons they have asked me to resign have nothing to dowith me personally.  They have been respectful to me, they have valued me ascapable person, but have found that given the direction of the company(which has become self-evident with the consequent developments), ""furtherAltra goes, further I will be frustrated with where they go.""  It was almostformulated that it is better for me to separate from Altra as soon as I can.As an evidence of appreciation, they have continued paying me as of today,something that they have not done for some others, but it is coming to itsend, too.  I am bringing this up just to reiterate that my separation fromAltra has had nothing to do with me or my entrepreneurial working style vs.corporate style, etc.  I have no doubts that I can function equally well ineither environment.I wish that your presentation goes well with your new superior, and that myjoining Enron becomes a possibility.Regards,Martin- martin.doc",Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT,vince.kaminski@enron.com,My resume,True

"You need to kick some butt here.The 2001 annual allocated premium for these assets for property insurance is $670,000 based upon ENA's 2001 reported value of approximately $470,000,000.  The pro-rata credit for 7 months, assuming a 5-31-01 sale date, would be $390,833.Underwriters require an update of values and exposures annually at renewal. Gathering these values within Enron normally requires 30 to 45 days.  We use these same values in the allocation system. Unless the value change is significant, the actual cost of insurance to the outside insurers will not change  Once you complete your entire study of replacement cost values, we can discuss whether approaching underwriters is warranted.If we internally adjust your allocation mid-year, we must move the premium that we take away from you to the other participants in the program.  As you know, the remainder of Enron did not stand still while you sold Bammel.  We have not tried this before, however, I suspect if approached with the additional premium as a result reducing ENA's allocation, all the other operating entities would want to re-submit their revised  values as well and we would find ourselves in a constant state of adjustment.  In view of the time required, this is neither practical nor cost effective for Enron.  In view of the relatively small numbers, I doubt that Corp. would entertain this proposition either, however, we can approach them if you wish..Please let me know how much of the 2000 insurance premium is being allocated to the approx. $700MM of HPL assets.  This charge is effectively ""a cost of capital"" and should be re-allocated to other groups with insured assets or should remain at Corp.Regards,Brian.This insurance is purchased on a portfolio basis with payment to underwriters at inception of the coverage. Values are adjusted annually at renewal. The premiums are allocated to the participating entities as part of the budget process and insignificant additions and deletions of assets do not normally result in premiums additions or refunds.  In the event that we discontinue premiums to North America for HLP, we have no mechanism to allocate that premium to the other assets that continue to be insured. In the event of a significant divestiture, underwriters may consider a refund, however, the values discussed below would not likely be significant when compared to Enron's values as a whole. Additionally, Enron's adverse loss experience affects the underwriters ability to return premium for small divestitures.At renewal, 4/01/02, North America's revised property values will be declared to underwriters as part of Enron's overall values and your premium allocation will adjust depending upon your values and loss experience as compared to the rest of Enron.Regards,Paul.Please confirm that ENA will not bear any insurance costs for the HPL assets for the second half of 2001 and the balance of years going forward?  If this is not the case, then we need to meet and discuss why this is not the case.Thanks,Brian.PaulIn addition to the 188,371,296 property value for Bammel Lease that you mentioned below there was also a value on your spreadsheet for Bammel Gas Storage of 267,000,000.  Requirements to insure both of these amounts should be with AEP not Enron and thus the 2002 Plan Premium Allocations of $754,096 on the Bammel Gas Storage 267,000,000 value and $924,433 on the Bammel Lease value of 188,371,296 should not be needed.JackiePlease remove these amounts from the ENA-HPL 2002 Plan..As discussed for the purposes of the 2002 Insurance Budget, we will delete the Bammel Lease (1409) property values of $188,371,296. We will advise the insurers effective this past June to delete these assets and will attempt to receive a refund. However, as respects asset divestitures, insurers have not been inclined in the past to refund premiums for comparatively small divestitures in view of our adverse loss experience. However, if we are successful in receiving a credit, we will refund the premium.I will discuss with Karen and Brian the other remaining assets.Regards,.Please update accordingly.Thanks,","Coffey Jr., Jim","Clayton, Paul",Replacement Cost Values,False

Unfortunately, thatprocess has not been finalized and as such, Dutch is not yet an associate.Ted is finalizing the process this week and it will likely require Dutch tointerview with 4 other commercial managers outside of ENA.Additionally, there are two other sr. spec. on the gas trading floor insimilar situations and we will be discussing them at a promotion meeting tobe held the first week of Jan.  I would like to handle all of theseconsistently and had planned to include Dutch's promotion in thisdiscussion.  I would recommend that we hold on a title change for Dutch untilafter this meeting and manage it through the promotions process.Per the message attached below, Dutch believes he has already received thetitle change.  Please clarify the situation with him at your earliestconvenience.  If you need my assistance with this please let me know.   Iapologize if there was any confusion from our previous discussions.

Rock didcall me saying that some pipe option spreadsheets were not loading throughthe new process and when I checked it seemed like a network problem and askedhim to run it again and it seemed to be OK.With the new process, there is no need for double quotes around the curvecode and counterparty code columns anymore. This has been automatically takencare of since we process from the spreadsheet itself. This was the originalproblem around the pipe option spreadsheets which we discovered yesterday andthe reason why the numbers did not match between the old and new processes.I also noticed that INTRA-NORTHEAST-PHY was officialised 4 times - 2 times ina row in quick succcession.I would like Rock or Robin to load these spreadsheets once again during theday with Virendra or me as early as possible. We have been consistently beenable to load these into the test data bases.The ng spreadsheet also has a quoted price curve code. It should not take anytime to convert these spreadsheets over.The ft_northwest sheet seems to be fine - just that it was put into the ngdirectory. Please advise them not to use this directory anymore. Any NT baseddirectory will give much better response.The surprises are the rll and the plastics text files.

"jessie.patterson@enron.comIf you have not yet volunteered, we still need people and would really appreciate your help.  Below is some information about the project we will be working on.  I will send more details to the definite volunteers.If we can't have your time, we would still like to borrow your tools.  Also, we are collecting food and baked goods to take to this man, who's only food is from Meals on Wheels (healthy stuff).I look forward to your responses letting me know how you'll be able to help.  If you have questions, please call me at 3-0322.Beth.Below is information about the house you will be volunteering at on Wednesday, August 8th.  Please send me a list of all the AA volunteers, as well as the ones who will be staying all day.This house is in need of outside repairs.  Mr. Elvin Rayes is an older man and lives there alone.  He is a veteran and is very proud and doesn't want to accept charity.  However, he is going to let us help him with the outside.  He was very nice when I met him on Sunday and I told him that all the people coming over to help were excited they didn't have to go to work for the day.  This made it seem like we were doing more of a favor for ourselves versus for him.  He liked that.  This house really needs a lot of TLCI would suggest everyone wear old clothes they don't mind painting in and their GREEN United Way t-shirts (shorts are fine but jeans may be better for those who want to mow - this is Houston and it's summer).  Below is a safety note one site leader sent out to his team.  You may want to forward this to your AA volunteers.Safety First!!!Let's make sure we are all safe. We all want to go home just like we get there - no injuries!!If you see someone working unsafe - either tell them, or tell me immediately (so I can tell them)!Plan your work, and discuss it with your work crew.Don't hurry, use common sense.Use the right tool for the jobBe careful lifting, lift with your legs, not your back.  If item is heavy or bulky, get help! - Don't be macho.Be sure to wear safety glass or goggles when appropriate (weed eating, power saws, grass mowing, etc).Wear work glovesMake sure ladders are secure, and either tied down or someone stabilizing the base.Be aware of people around you and what they are doing.TasksHere are the main tasks at the Ettrick house.  Once everyone gets out there, we can shift the work according to everyone's preference as long as the work gets done.  People may work on more than one task depending on progress, congestion, and what people would like to do.Replace rotten outside trim boardsReplace garage door (rotten on bottom)Trim trees with chainsaw - especially in the back yardReplace soffit screeningClean bathroom - 2 peopleYard work - trim hedges, mow and edgeReplace screen doorCaulk around the windowsScrape old paint and paint outsideReplace window screensReplace doorbellToolsHere is the list of tools.  Bring what you have and make sure to put your name on it with a permanent marker.  Please let me know if you are missing any tools and I will do my best to get them there.

The Wharton offers  asymposium in Paris on June 10on High Tech Acquisitions  and it would make a lot of sense if you(or somebody from London you could identify) could attend and help us toevaluate the usefulnessof this project.I am enclosing the message from the person in Wharton running this program.Vince---------------------- Forwarded by Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 06/05/2000Vincent,It was truly a pleasure getting to know you in our meeting yesterday, and Ilook forward to the prospect of exchanging views in the future on a varietyof topics pertaining to emerging technologies.Per our discussion, I've enclosed three files that include an invitation,agenda and rsvp form for the June 10 symposium on High Tech Acquisitions atInsead.  If you or the individual(s) who will be attending have anyyou can call him at 215-898-1231.This initiative will be expanded during the coming year and I believe thatEnron's involvement will give the company access to some of the earlyresearch in progress as it unfolds, and of course, if you become involvedas a partner in the Emerging Technologies Program you would haveopportunities to help guide the direction of the research which is one ofthe partnership ""benefits.""Friday, September 8""WHAT NEXT ON THE INTERNET?""This is a faculty update day with industry partners also invited.We will co-sponsor this with Wharton's major e-Business initiative.Major issues addresses include ""New Economics of the Web"" and""Internet, Anywhere.""Friday, October 20""FIRST MOVER ADVANTAGE, SHAKEOUTS & SURVIVAL STRATEGIES""Designed by the ET core group andpresented in collaboration with the e-Commerce Forum.As I indicated during our discussion, participation in the EmergingTechnologies Management Research Program is by invitation and on behalf ofour core faculty, I am pleased to extend an invitation for Enron to jointhe program.To assist in your decision, we recommend having a representative attend thesymposium in Paris on June 10 to ""test drive"" the program.I'll send you a formal invitation which you are free to accept at yourconvenience, should you agree that Enron's participation in the ET Programwould be of value.Please call or email if you have any comments or questions.best regards,Michael- Insead workshop Invitation lett - Insead Workshop Agenda1.doc - RSVPform.docMichael S.

In other words, when they were trying to get AB 1890passed, when they were fighting Proposition 9, when they floated their ""ratereduction bonds"" and when they talked to analysts and rating agencies I'msure they assumed that they would live under the rate freeze and take therisk of stranded cost recovery whithin the statutory deadline.""Dick S George"" <dsgeorge@firstworld.net>CC list suppressed...September 27, 2000California Utilities' LossesOn Electricity Pose RiskBy REBECCA SMITHStaff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNALCalifornia's two biggest utilities are losing so muchmoney buying electricity in the state's deregulatedmarket that they have run up deficits equivalent to halftheir net worth in just four months.If the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed theprice these utilities are allowed to bill theircustomers, as currently seems likely, they could becometechnically insolvent sometime next year. That would putpressure on regulators to orchestrate amultibillion-dollar public bailout, similar to the ""toobig to fail'' response that in the past pushedgovernments to rescue banks.Such a scenario is quietly being discussed by bond-ratingconcerns that recently reduced their credit outlooks forPacific Gas & Electric Co., a unit of San Francisco-basedPG&E Corp., and Southern California Edison, a unit ofEdison International of Rosemead, Calif. Bond- ratingconcerns say they aren't sure how much additional debtcan be borne by the two affected utilities before theywill have difficulty paying their bills.Probe of California Power Prices Begins, but New PlantsAren't Seen as Solution (Sept. 11)Los Angeles Utility Is Benefitting, Surprisingly, FromDeregulation (Sept. 6)California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Electricity Costs(Sept. 1)""If this is just a seasonal aberration, the utilities canget through it,"" says Lori Woodland, analyst for FitchIBCA. ""If it goes on for six or nine months, it's a veryserious situation."" Adds A.J. Sabatelle, senior creditpoint, you have a financial crisis.""The utilities say they are having no difficulty meetingexpenses and don't envision problems in servicing theirdebts. But they are vigorously lobbying state and federalregulators to change the rules of the game, hopingsomehow to raise rates to make up for the shortfall. TheCalifornia utilities' experience may be a harbinger ofwhat could happen in other states where wholesale powerprices have surpassed the amount that utilities areallowed to charge their ratepayers.For now, utilities are making ends meet by going to thefinancial markets to borrow money. PG&E, a giant utilitythat serves one out of every 20 Americans, is seekingapproval to increase its debt capacity by $1.4 billion.It is borrowing $200 million, while Edison is tapping$250 million from the commercial paper market. ""This isgoing to be a long, tough road,"" says Jim Scilacci, chieffinancial officer for Southern California Edison.Today's situation represents a complete turnabout fromwhat was expected when California deregulated its energymarket on March 31, 1998, which opened electricitypricing to competition. California tried to give itsutilities a competitive edge nationally by deregulatingfaster than other states and by creating a mechanism toallow investor-owned utilities, such as PG&E and Edison,to quickly pay down debts incurred to serve customersunder the old regulatory system.To do this, the state legislature set retail rates athigh levels, which, at first, generated fat surpluses forthe utilities. As the money piled up, utilities used itto pay down debts for generation facilities that wereotherwise unprofitable in the new deregulated world. Bythe end of this June, PG&E and Edison together hadcollected more than $12 billion and were on track tofinish paying down debts well ahead of the March 31,2002, deadline set by the legislature. At that point,rate freezes were to end and retail prices were tofluctuate with the market.But all that went out the window in June, when wholesalepower prices surged, topping the rates the utilities wereallowed to charge retail customers. Average prices atstate-sanctioned energy markets were four to five timesthe prices of a year earlier, and three to four times thelevel utilities could charge customers.The accumulated shortfall has been so enormous at PG&E,that analysts expect its deficit to exceed $3 billion byOct. 31, more than half its shareholder equity of $5.7billion, which is defined as assets minus liabilities.Southern California Edison finished August with a deficitof $2 billion, equivalent to almost two-thirds its networth of $3.2 billion. The utilities, though they havebeen accumulating deficits, aren't required to reportthese as losses on their earnings statements.That leaves utilities in a bind. They want to end therate freeze to be able to pass on the real cost ofelectricity to consumers. But should the freeze endbefore the statutory deadline of 2002, they getclobbered. That is because they will immediately have tobook a loss on their power-purchase deficits. What'smore, they can't use the proceeds from plannedpower-plant sales to cover those losses; instead, shouldthe freeze end, they will be obliged to refund some ofthe proceeds to ratepayers. In PG&E's case, the refundscould total $500 million, while in Edison's case, theamount is $254 million.Publicly at least, utility executives insist a mechanismwill be found to let them recoup the money spent onelectricity.Consumer advocates are gearing up for the fight. NettieHoge, executive director for San Francisco consumer groupUtility Reform Network, says ratepayers shouldn't end upfooting the bill for a deal cut by utilities thatbenefited them before prices shot up.Utility executives are now distancing themselves from thelegislation that got them into such a mess, which wasdrafted with their assistance. PG&E Chairman Robert Glynnsays it is best not to ""overanalyze"" the ""old deal.""Instead, he says, regulators and legislators should sitdown with utilities and construct a new agreement, since""it's in the broad interests of the state not to havecritical energy infrastructure look like a leper.""Mr. Glynn says the current deal offers ""mutually assureddestruction"" to both utilities and ratepayers. Somethingmust be done, he says, or consumers throughout most ofthe state will experience ""a San Diego-style rate shock.""The utility serving that city, San Diego Gas & ElectricCo., ended its freeze a year ago and began passingwholesale power costs directly through to ratepayers.Legislators intervened this summer, however, andtemporarily capped retail rates when monthly power billsnearly tripled. The utility, a unit of Sempra Energy, isalso accumulating a deficit as a result.So long as banks and bond markets believe the utilitieswill be repaid, they will be able to borrow, analystssay. ""Until we hear politicians of consequence stateotherwise, our position is that we believe the utilitieswill be made whole,"" says Richard Cortright, a directorat Standard & Poor's corporate ratings group.But that opinion could change if it looks like thelower credit ratings that would raise borrowing costs andcould trigger a downward spiral. ""You're talking abouttop-rated companies, though,"" said Ms. Woodland of FitchIBCA. ""To get to insolvency, a lot would have to happen.""In the meantime, utilities are doing all they can tocontrol the hemorrhaging. They have gotten authority fromregulators to buy more power under long-term contracts atfixed prices, reducing their vulnerability to spot-marketvolatility. And they have petitioned federal regulatorsto declare California's market so badly flawed thatgenerators should be denied market pricing and, even,ordered to pay refunds.Nevertheless, several forces are working against them.Although they can sign bilateral contracts, prices remainhigh for those as well. What's more, they can't buy lesspower than their customers need. If they don't buyenough, the California Independent System Operator, theorganization responsible for reliability, will step inand make purchases for them and send them the bill.Perhaps the biggest problem facing PG&E and Edison,though, is one of timing. The California legislature isout of session until December, and regulators haven'teven really started to address the issue formally. In themeantime, the utilities' deficit is growing by tens ofmillions of dollars daily.Write to Rebecca Smith at rebecca.smith@wsj.com",skean@enron.com,jeff.dasovich@enron.com,PG&E's Huge losses...,True

(For that matter we maynot be able to resell gas on a spot basis if the counterparty does not takeon a given day.)

Not filled yet for that time period.  They are sending me abrochure.  Only potential draw back there is that most of their rooms haveonly king size beds and sleep two persons.  There are 2 rooms that have twobeds, and two cottages that have sleeper sofas.  They do have baby beds.Families of 2 or 3 can be accomodated fine.  I would probably take tworooms, one for the girls and one for Tyler, David and me.  But we wouldprobably do that in New York or San Francisco, too.  As we all know, fiveis almost too many in one room and bathroom.I think that dinner in Austin on June 2 and a trip at Thanksgiving soundslike a good plan.  Do you guys want to cover that with Mom and Dad and askabout the San Antonio/Sun City crowd?Hello, Sista -Sally and I spoke this morning (I know you guys spoke last night as well) -Since August, Sept., and Oct.  are pretty much impossible for a trip, howabout we schedule a trip - possibly to NYC or San Fran. - duringTHanksgiving.  This seems ideal since we always get together anyway at thattime - and nobody will have to remove kids from school.  Sally thinks maybewe could travel Tuesday - Saturday and avoid some of the ThanksgivingtravelMADNESS.  Also, it pushes the travel even further into the year, which mayhelp you.Then, we can have a family dinner for Mom and Dad on June 2 somewhere inAustin.

Thanks for being so cooperative.I agree that makes a lot of sense, that is certainly where we are spending ourtime, and good management of that so far, is what is contributing to earningshigher than expected....that and the crazy California markets. We're alwaysglad to have you visit, and could provide a detailed discussion if that's whatyou would prefer. We are spending a great deal of time on this in the salespresentations and have a number of overheads, and some written informationthat we use in our position meetings that we could send to you to start with.The rate case is in a very dynamic state, but we believe moving in rightdirection. The power position is in constant review based on projected loads,demand side management opportunities, and blocks of energy available atreasonable prices in the future for our customers. We are still operatingunder an obligation to serve, as we don't see that changing anytime in thenear future and those utilities in the west that have gotten in trouble arethose who haven't provided for customers. Commissions seem to be giving rateincreases for increasing prices if prudent management was attempted, but notjust for stopping based on possible belief of dereg. We have a sharingmechanism right now that shares risks and rewards between customers andshareholders. During this sales process we had spent a lot of time workingthrough with Sierra on this, and now with the new possible buyers. Most likeit when they finally understand. It is not regulation 101, it is very complexand leading edge, but get the risks and rewards aligned much better forshareholdes and customers. Doesn't fit Enron's view of dereg, but Oregon willnot get to Enron's view anytime soon, especially with California situation,and it's not just Oregon regulators, it's Oregon customers including theindustrials that are  reliability sensitive like high techs and health care.Sorry for the long note....how about if I start by sending you someinformation from presentations, and then we can look at schedules for when ameeting might work. You might even want to come to one of the bankerpresentations. Mark M and Mitch were both in Seattle yesterday, and couldshare with you some of the discussion related to these subjects. Mitch thoughtwe might have another in a week or so.....After returning home and reviewing the material handed out at the PGE businessreview, there are two areas that I think I need to understand better.

"Privileged and Confidential -- request for legal advice.Are we required to have a formal severance plan?  Can we opt not to have a severance plan and simply handle matters on a case-by-case basis (perhaps with ""rule of thumb"" guidelines)?If we are required to have such a plan, should we centrally administer the plan to avoid inconsistencies?My original message regarding the employee involved was raising a somewhat broader concern.  Perhaps because our plans are complicated, we have had occasions where an employee was told something, what he/she was told was incorrect, he/she changed position based on what he/she was told, and then we made the employee bear the risk of the mistake.  Obviously, the right answer is to get it right the first time, but on those occasions where we made the mistake, do we have the flexibility to fix it?.Document attached","Kean, Steven J.; Barrow, Cynthia",FMackin@aol.com],Communication and Policy Problems,False

Jim Crist, a lecturer with IGT  is preparing a day-longseminar customized to our interests and issues.Here is my ""top 4 list"" on why GPG staff need to increase our understandingof the electric industry.First and foremost, gas-fired electric generation is the growth market forgas pipelines.  We need to get a sense of why and where generation is beingbuilt and who the likely customers are.  This involves understanding thedifferent between utility generation and merchant plants, the dynamics ofsiting, understanding a little bit about how utilities plan and economicallyjustify generation investments.Second, we need to understand electric utilities as customers.  Who is thecustomer these days -- the generator?  Who should we be dealing with withinthe utility organization.  What types of load patterns should we expectvarious types of electric players?  What types of services do they need?  Wealso need to get a sense of how the timing of their processescompare/contrast to our processes on the gas side.Third, we need to understand the regulatory climate on the electric side andthe implications for electric generation demand growth.  We need tounderstand the state/federal jurisdictional issues.  We need to learn aboutthe debates over ATC, TLR, locational marginal pricing, price caps, andcontrol areas.  We need to understand how these issues fit into Enron'sposition in support of restructuring the electric industry, unbundlingtransmission, removing native load exceptions, and avoiding prices caps andwe need to understand how these debates affect GPG.Fourth, we need to understand electric tariffs and practices, services andOASIS because the FERC has started to insist on common rules between gas andelectric.  The recent electric interconnection policy has now been applied onthe gas side.  FERC is talking about imposing the RTO principles onpipelines. And, we hear a lot of comparisons between OASIS and pipelineEBBs.  We want to learn how to take advantage of electric best practiceswhere it makes sense and on the flip side, know how to argue against theimposition of electric rules on our pipelines where there are legitimatedifferences between gas and electric.I've shared this list of interests with Jim Crist as he prepares a customizedseminar for us.  Please feel free to email me with any other areas ofinterest for the course.   I will keep you posted on the specific location asthings progress.  In the meantime, please make sure to save the date!Please pass this notice along to others in your organization that may beinterested.","Caroline Barnes/FGT/Enron@ENRON, Martha Benner/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Lynn",jeffery.fawcett@enron.com,Save the Date - August 25,False

Spot refining marginsare expected to trend downward, with the possibility of periods of upwardvolatility. Key factors that will influence the path of margins for the balanceof this year and into 2002 include*  weakening supply-demand fundamentals, as weak economies and reducedcommercial air travel drive down demand*  OPEC production policy and its effect on inventory levels*  supply security concerns, including perceived risks of disruptions tophysical supply that could result from new attacks or military action**end**Follow above URL for complete report (9 printed pages).**********************************************************************************************************************************************On September 17, CERA Chairman, Daniel Yergin, led a GlobalClient Conference Call discussion on the potential economicand energy industry fallout from the recent terrorist attackson New York and Washington DC.The playback of this conference call is now available at on theor 719-457-0820 (outside the United States).

Burton will not recess the Senate onThursday unless the Senate passes the budget that the Assembly passed lastnight (7-17). However a key Democrat, Sen. Sheila Kuehl, has been is in Italyand is on a 16 hour return flight. No one knows if she has been told toreturn and without her presence, two Republican votes are still needed topass any urgency measure for the budget.  Kuehl's vote is crucial if theytake the bill up on Thursday.MOU MayhemThere are currently three leading MOU plans being resuscitated by theCalifornia House and Senate deliberations.  Senator Burton is hoping to keepthe published schedule and adjourn for a month's recess on Thursday evening.Speaker Hertzberg is reportedly not thrilled with leaving until the Edisonissue is resolved.  However, rumor is that whether or not they recess onThursday, their adjournment will mark the end of the Second Extraordinarysession and all XX  bills passed and signed will go into effect in 90 days(all others will be dead).  Although Davis has stressed the urgency ofpassing a comprehensive ""bail-out"" plan and even threatened to call anemergency session to prevent legislators from taking a 30-day recess onFriday, there is no clear indication that legislators will comply with thisrequest.? Hertzberg's bill 82XX - Of the more obvious differences from Davis MOU,82XX proposes to offer SoCal $300 M less for its transmission lines inaddition to penalizing Edison if it fails to act in good faith in closing thedeal.  It comes as no surprise that during bill deliberations, SoCal raisedobjections to the bill and warned of impending difficulties (bankruptcy) forSo Cal were the bill left unamended.? The Wright-Richman bill 83XX - We reported last week that 83XX remains theonly measure fueled by bipartisan support.  AB 83XX was heard in an""informational"" hearing yesterday (7-17) and will be heard again today in theAssembly Energy Committee.  Assemblyman Rod Wright, the Chairman of theCommittee, presented AB 83xx with Dr. Keith Richman, a Republican Assemblymanfrom Southern California. They offered 83XX as an Edison bail-out, pure andsimple. Wright was clear to distinguish his bill from 82XX, which he said hasconservation easements and land requisitions, a renewable portfolio whichwill add an additional fee on ratepayers, and reasonable review for long termcontracts. While the chances of the Richman bill being successful appearslim, reports that that Hertzberg will try to negotiate elements of his ownbill (82XX) as amendments to the Wright/Richman measure suggest that at leastHertzberg feels Richman's 83XX stands a chance.? The Byron Sher bill, SB 78XX (Polanco) - Previously presented by Sen.Polanco on behalf of Governor Davis, SB 78XX has received special attentionfrom Senate President, John Burton.  Although it has never been heard by acommittee, SB 78XX is currently on the Senate floor and ready for a vote. TheSenate Energy Committee and Senate Appropriations Committee are bothscheduled to have informational hearings on this bill today.  Note, themeetings are informational because neither committee has possession of thebill.  These hearings will provide information to committee members, avoid aformal vote, and simultaneously shield Burton/Polanco from claims that thedetails of SB78XX were never released.  The Senate is scheduled to be insession tomorrow, ostensibly to vote on the state budget and SB 78XX. GivenBurton's penchant for wanting to keep on schedule to recess tomorrow, thereis no guarantee that he will hold the Senate in session once they hear SB78XX. Thus, the Senate may never even see AB 82XX and AB 83XX unless eitheror both bills are passed out of the Assembly today and get special treatmentby Burton to be heard tomorrow. Burton has previously adjourned the Senate tokeep on schedule once they finish their business, even if the Assembly isbehind them.","Sanders, Richard B.; Edison, Andrew","Whitman, Britt",California Update 7-18-2001,True

"Gentlemen--thought you guys might be interested in this exchange on GrayDavis's visit to Mayor Daley.  EES has been trying to do a deal with the Cityof Chicago for quite a while now, and they are getting down to the wire indeciding whether to go ahead as the deal is going to have to go before theCity Council next month for approval.Michael Lindert@EESLandwehr/NA/Enron@EnronRoy and Ed,Actually, this is a non-event for us.  Davis was in town to review the City'semergency action plan in the event of massive or rolling blackouts.  SteveWalter met with him to brief him of the City's extremely thorough emergencyplan which was a result of the power outages a few summers ago.  The City islooked to across the country as having a state-of-the-art plan thatencompasses over 1,600 critical facilities classified with an A-C rating.Each of these City, County or State facitlities had a ""hook-up"" plateinstalled on the outside of the building so a portable generator could bemoved into place in an emergency.  The plan also covers procedures, planning,operations support center set up, etc.  Very comprehensive.  I suppose Mr.Davis may just be thinking ahead....MikePS.  If the conversation actually did extend into what else the City is doingabout electricity and Enron's name also came up, I doubt that we would beviewed negatively at all, in fact, the exact opposite.  We are part ofDaley's plan to lessen his reliance on the terrible utility.  We are thehammer and our long-term contract reinforces our relationship.  You can restassured, if California could do it all over again, long-term contracts wouldbe a key component of a successful move to deregulation...not spot marketpurchases through a PX!  Ah yes, Chicago, the apple of Gov. Davis' eye...Migden/NA/Enron@Enron, Susan M Landwehr/NA/Enron@EnronEd -- I don't think that this would change what we are trying to do nor theway we're doing it.  Daley is not afraid to take non-liberal positions whenit best fits his ends ( e.g., he has made statements supporting thePresident's energy policy because he has more faith in increasing supplyrather than in demand reductions) but since this is politics one can never beentirely sure.  I'm sure that Daley knows Enron very well and especiallywhere Mr. Lay placed his support during the last election.  My read on thisalgnment is that Daley will do what it takes to keep the energy issue frombecoming a ""snow storm"" type of issue -- for non-Chicagoans that refers tothe ability for administrations to change over how well the City clearsneighborhood streets during the previous winter's snow days.Edward HambLindert/HOU/EES@EESThe bold highlight appears in Sunday gossip column of the Chicago Suntimes -does this meeting change the politicaldynamics of the deal - Davis adversial relationship with Enron - is thissomething we should be worried aboutMay 20, 2001BY MICHAEL SNEED SUN-TIMES COLUMNISTScoopsville . . .Watch for California Gov.

"Tony, I thought there would be a case that stated that if an interstatepipeline posts the criteria under which it will evaluate capacity bids, itmust stick to those criteria and not award the capacity to a bidder on someother basis.  It seems a simple enough extension of the principle thatcapacity must be awarded on a nondiscriminatory basis.  However, I did notfind any case that stands for that exact proposition.  As you may be aware,the Commission made Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) come upwith a way to ensure that it awarded capacity one a nondiscriminatorybasis...because NGPL was found to have been giving preferential treatment toits shippers.  NGPL's solution was to come up with an auction process, andthere is a whole line of cases if you're interested.  The underlyingpresumption is that if you set up a system under which all capacity isawarded and stick with that system, there is no way you could be actingdiscriminatorily.  But of course the Commission never comes out and says thiseven though it should be obvious.Probably the best we can do is extrapolate from 1) the tariff and 2) the NGA(doesn't it also say we have to provide service on a not unduly discrim.basis?).  Also, in your memo I'd give an example; i.e., if we notify shippersof our auction process and set a deadline for bidding, but then award thecapacity to Sempra (assuming Sempra requested capacity after the posting), wewill have unduly discriminated against all the other shippers who had toparticipate in the auction process.Maybe in future postings on Enrononline we should include a statement to theeffect that the capacity posted will not be awarded except thru theEnrononline process.Now for some trivia.  Remember we were discussing with Shelley whether wecould post a different method (other than that prescribed in the tariff) fordetermining best bid?  In my Westlaw search I ran across the relevant case.Commission has previously given pipelines the leeway, in open seasonprovisions, to either include in their tariff a single non-discriminatory bidevaluation methodology, or provide themselves the flexibility of choosingdifferent non-discriminatory bid evaulation methods for differenttransactions, provided that the pipeline posts the bid evaluation methodologybefore the bidding process begins.""  The only problem is I am not sure wehave that ""flexibility"" since the tariff does not expressly allow us to posta different method.  Maybe next time we do a tariff cleanup we could add somelanguage allowing us to do so.I have to move on to my next project but if you want me to comment on whatyou write I'd be happy to.",tony.pryor@enron.com,susan.scott@enron.com,thoughts on Enrononline,False

During September 2000  daylightsaving will start early in Sydney during the Olympics. As a result there willbe a 1 hour time difference between Sydney and Melbourne.  The local time asreported by the Bureau of Meteorology is Melbourne time. Hence if there is tobe a reference to a time zone it should time zone applicable to thatlocation. More generally we should put a definition of ""LST ""in documentationas meaning the time at the relevant weather station.

or were they in thecondensate when the cargo was loaded? obviously, testing of the shore sampleprior to loading will determine the answer. if the shore sample is ok, thenthey had to come from the ship. if the shore sample also has bugs, then weshould be claiming against our suppliers.this of course assumes the suggestion put forth by sgs is in fact correct.just something else to be considered.2) i am not saying that we pay the full amount immediately but only thefreight portion (about $500,000). we then advise mitsubishi (or theirlawyers) that we will now review the demurrage claim (about $260,000) andrevert by say end nov. the demurrage claim has been sent to our londonoffice's demurrage department and i have asked them for their comments on theclaim. after all, there may be issues with the ship's pumping performance orsimple laytime errors which may reduce the demurrage claim. they will try toget me a response before the weekend.in this manner, we pay part of the money but still have a smaller portionwhich we may apply against our claim once the test results are known. i willleave this to legal as to decide how the approach to mitsubishi or theirlawyers should be madergds",britt.davis@enron.com,paul.henking@enron.com,In re M/V PACIFIC VIRGO,True

As you know, we have issues in Canada abouttaking cash collateral, which issues have been clearly identified andcommunicated by Peter previously (see his e-mails of March 20, 2001).However, as opposed to cash, it appears clear under our personal propertyregistration legislation that a certified cheque and a bank draft would fallunder the definition of ""instruments"".  Under such legislation, as Peter hasindicated below, a security interest in ""instruments"" can be perfected bypossession, thus eliminating the need to register the security interest atthe personal property registry, which requirement to register creates theperfection and priority concerns we have with holding cash collateral.Therefore, at first blush, it seems that a counterparty providing a certifiedcheque or bank draft to us (in lieu of cash collateral or a letter ofcredit), which certified cheque or bank draft would be held by us in the samemanner as we hold L/Cs, might solve our cash collateral concerns and makeanother credit instrument available to us for use in Canada.There are a few concerns, which I think are raised by your questions.  Thefirst is that, if we take the instrument and immediately convert it to cashand place the cash in an account, we run into the exact same issues as wehave with taking cash collateral in the first place.  The personal propertysecurity legislation specifically indicates that proceeds realized fromdealing with the original collateral need to be perfected in the same manneras original collateral of the same kind (ie. where the proceeds from the bankdraft are cash, we need to then perfect our security interest in the cash asif the original collateral was cash, meaning we have the exact same issues aswe currently have with perfecting a security interest in cash collateral).Therefore, we would need to deal with the instrument (bank draft or certifiedcheque) in the same manner as we deal with L/Cs.  That is, we would cash theinstrument in payment of outstanding accounts at the time that we becomeentitled under the contract to apply our collateral against amounts owing tous from the counterparty.  We would have to actually hold the certifiedcheque or bank draft until such entitlement arose.The requirement to hold the bank draft or certified cheque for a potentiallyextended period of time raises another concern about how long such aninstrument can remain outstanding before it becomes ""stale dated"" and thusundrawable.  In other words, it may well be that a bank will only allow suchinstruments to be drawable if they are presented for payment within areasonable time of their issuance.  This is one point that would requirefurther research if we are going to consider utlizing such instruments ascollateral, since the answer could obviously make the use of such instrumentsa solution for only very short term transactions, if at all.The final point I would make is also raised by your second question below.My understanding is that the law in Canada has been somewhat grey in the pastwith respect to whether a person who issues a certified cheque (or the bankon which the certified cheque is drawn) can stop payment on such a chequeafter it has been issued.  I believe that there may have been some recentOntario decisions indicating that a cheque, once certified, must be honouredupon presentment and if the bank upon which the certified cheque is drawnrefuses to pay, it will be liable for the amount.  However, we would need tolook into this point further, as any risk that a certified cheque can bewithdrawn by the payor at any time after it has been issued obviouslyeliminates the benefit of the collateral.  I do not believe that the sameconcern exists for a bank draft, as I believe it represents a fully fundedobligation of the bank to pay, which is irrevocable.If we wish to consider using such instruments as an alternate form ofcollateral, I would suggest that we have such use vetted by outside counseland obtain an opinion as to the viability and risks associated with suchuse.  Since Stikeman Elliott provided our opinion with respect to cashcollateral, I would suggest that we use them to provide the advice on thesepoints as well.  Please let me know if you would like me to instruct outsidecounsel to proceed.ThanksGregGaffney/TOR/ECT@ECT, Greg Johnston/CAL/ECT@ECT, Mark Powell/CAL/ECT@ECT, MaryCook/HOU/ECT@ECT, Russell Diamond/Enron@EnronXGate, SaraShackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, TanyaRohauer/Enron@EnronXGate, William  S Bradford/Enron@EnronXGateCan we convert the draft into cash and still maintain our security interest?If not, can we get the bank to somehow guarantee that the funds will be there- in the US that would require either certification by the bank of thecustomer's draft or the issuance of an actual bank or cashier's check.Peter KeohaneHendry/NA/Enron@Enron, Mary Cook/HOU/ECT@ECT, Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT@ECT,Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, William S Bradford/HOU/ECT, Russell Diamond/HOU/ECT,Tanya Rohauer/HOU/ECTGaffney/TOR/ECT@ECTGreg Johnston may have a solution to the limitation on Canadian cashcollateral.  Without getting into detail, a security interest in an""instrument"" can be perfected by possession under the Personal PropertySecurity Act, and an ""instrument"" includes a bank draft.  If counterpartieswere to provide bank drafts on the same terms as they provide LCs we couldrely on perfection by possession.  Is this something we should investigatefurther?

"As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.

This is only fair to our employees so that they know thecriteria upon which they will be evaluated in advance.2)  The PRC system needs to be changed whereby any and all people that arewilling to provide input on performance of any individual can be done withouta bunch of red tape.  There is this idea that unsolicited input works withinthe system, but it requires too much effort to get throught the hurdles andit still requires that the supervisor approve such input.  There needs to bean unobstructed communication line for this input.  The theory of upwardfeedback should also be questioned.  I have never been asked to provide inputto my direct boss (President of Houston Pipe Line) in all the years that Ihave worked for that position.  Are Managing Directors exempt from thisprocess?  This issue is also addressed in #3 below in a different manner.How can appropriate feedback be given if those that work directly withindividuals are not given the opportunity to communicate?3)  There is still way too much preferrential selection of reviewers in theprocess.  There should be set out for each employee a listing of absoluteminimum reviewers (certain people) that must be solicited, depending upon thejob function.  I have seen too many circumstances where the obvious people toprovide input were not even solicited.  There was one individual thatpartially worked directly for another during this past review period and wasnot even asked for input.4)  What constitutes an average employee and what that category is within ourPRC definitions is still being debated.  It has been described by several HRrepresentatives that it is either/and both Strong or Satisfactory.  Neitherone of the definitions describes such performance as ""simply doing the job"".Because of such confusion, the reviewers when they provide input do noteffectively and precisely rate the employee.  What we end up with in the PRCis an over-inflated representation of each employee and the committee has topull the entire group back a notch.  With better definitions andcommunication to our employees on how to interpret the definitions, it willgive us a better process and set the standards in writing that seem to belacking.Thanks for your listening ear.",Office Chairman/Corp/Enron@ENRON,michelle.cash@enron.com,Performance Review Process,False

"This is the response I put together for Louise.This may be better done in person.  If so, give me a call when you have time.Here is my vision of the two worlds - Enron and Commodity Logic.If you see Commodity Logic as an independent venture, then we should build-inindependence in our communication of deal data.  The ""Transaction Store"" doesthis.  Beth's DriveTrain project being led by John Simmons will providethis.  In this model, not every function/system currently performed will besupplanted by a Commodity Logic module.  Complete reliance on Commodity Logicto provide deal data needed for these systems would certainly complicate theintegration as Commodity Logic may reside outside the firewall.   TheTrade Capture, Contracts, Valuation, Credit, and SAP functions.Additionally, we would like to see the development of more reporting supportfor the DPR, Operations Pricing Model, EnTelligence, and SAP Warehouse data;the implementation of a workflow, issue-tracking tool; and an Enron-brandedsite for Customer Information.   This vision was arrived at by asking thecompetitive advantage, control issues, or confidentiality?""I started shopping this vision around last week and will continue to do sothis week to get feedback for finalization.If the two are really one and will be managed as one going forward, thencertainly a single deal database could suffice.  In this case, there shouldnot be separately managed IT functions as redundant development efforts mayoccur and we could focus the resources on the top priorities.  Right now,Commodity Logic is heavily dependent upon Beth's resources to provide thedata from the legacy systems.  The work to do these data feeds competes withother priorities currently underway such as Unify Performance, Alberta OpenAccess for Power, etc.  I think it is important to note that we have twodifferent requirements for deal data.  One - to support Commodity Logicfunctions - is transactional and near-realtime in nature.  The second - tosupport reporting functions is probably a batch end of day process.  Thetechnical design of the two would be different to meet functional andperformance requirements.  So, in a combined world, there would stillprobably be two sources of deal data, one present on our network as separatemessages for each deal that transactional systems build a listener tosubscribe to and  a second source in a warehouse for reporting.Either alternative can be approached, however organizational alignment andpriorities might be different.  Further, if the intent is to break CommodityLogic off into a separate entity, then the first alternative is preferred tomaintain arms-length independence.Another alternative is to consider Operations and Commodity Logic as acombined entity that is separate from Enron that offers systems andback-office services to Enron and other industry players.  I think this maybe what Sally is envisioning.  If this is where we are headed, then some ofBeth's resources that are directly tied to support of Operations' systemsshould be combined with Commodity Logic resources so we can have a focus oncoordinated priorities.  I believe this alternative has the same issues asthe first in terms of what is outsourced, e.g. becomes part of CommodityLogic, and what remains proprietary and confidential to Enron.Let me know your thoughts.",sally.beck@enron.com,mary.solmonson@enron.com,Deal Database,True

But in the wake of post-agree=ment disclosures by Enron that its future earnings are likely to be substan=tially less than expected, the company's stock has been hammered. In 1 p.m.=trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Enron shares fell 30 cen=ts to $4.71. The stock is down 94% so far this year and far short of the pe=r-share takeover price. Dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $40.40.Although Dynegy and Enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under=the terms negotiated, Dynegy does appear to have other options. The agreem=ent with Enron contains a broad ""material adverse change"" clause as well as=some specific trigger points that could be invoked.=20Dynegy officials performed ""due diligence"" throughout the holiday weekend, =seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of Enron, which has suffe=red a series of damaging blows. Since mid-October, Enron has disclosed that=some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved=assets off Enron's balance sheet, for a time, to several private partnersh=ips. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissio=n investigation. Past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an ""=accounting error"" by Enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since O=ct. 16. At one point, Enron restated downwards nearly five years of earning=s.=20An Enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the=deal would be completed as agreed. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the tw=o sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk-away provi=sions ""are broad, by design, to ensure adequate protection for Dynegy share=holders."" Shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreemen=t.=20Clauses related to a ""material adverse change,"" also known as a ""material a=dverse effect,"" have been the focus of much attention among merger professi=onals this year, due, in part, to the stock market's fluctuations and the e=conomic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisi=tions.=20But such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are c=onsidered extremely difficult to prove.

Despite a $35 billion merger completed in Octobe=r, ChevronTexaco Corp. is still not one of the oil superpowers. Nor, at mor=e than $90 billion a year in revenues, is it a scrappy little guy. So Chair=man David J. O'Reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drillin=g for more oil and gas.=20. Chevron Corp. has owned 26% of Dynegy Inc. since 1996, and with Dynegy's =planned acquisition of Enron Corp., the top energy trader, ChevronTexaco is=making the oil industry's most aggressive push yet into this fast-growing =business. It plans to eventually pump $2.5 billion into the combined Dynegy=and Enron to maintain its 26% stake, and it might raise that share. So, wh=ile ChevronTexaco's much bigger rivals run small in-house trading operation=s, energy trading may soon account for more than 10% of ChevronTexaco's ear=nings. ``Chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business,'' says a=nalyst Arjun Murti at Goldman, Sachs & Co.The deal would certainly dovetail with ChevronTexaco's strategy of becoming=a more integrated energy company, with a hand in everything from pumping o=il at the wellhead to trading natural-gas futures. By acquiring Texaco, Che=vron picked up, for instance, a big refining-and-marketing business --which=should balance out the bad times in oil and gas production, says Eugene No=wak, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``When crude-oil prices are down, they'll have=margin improvements on refining and marketing,'' he says. O'Reilly and oth=er ChevronTexaco executives declined to comment.=20Until now, Dynegy wasn't a big deal for Chevron. Chevron purchased the stak=e for $700 million when Dynegy was still called NGC Corp., and it filled th=ree of the 14 board seats--positions it will keep.

The stake ha==20Sitting on $2.9 billion in cash as of the end of the second quarter, Chevro=nTexaco can well afford the Dynegy deal, analysts say.

CEO Charles L. Watson if he had sat=back and gloated. After all, Watson had watched as his bigger, brasher cro=sstown rival sniffed at Dynegy's more cautious strategy, all the while garn=ering most of the credit for reshaping the energy-trading business.=20Instead, Watson picked up the phone on Oct. 24 and called Enron Chairman, C=EO, and longtime acquaintance Kenneth L. Lay to ask how he could help. Lay =didn't respond immediately, but as Enron's stock continued to plunge and th=e company faced a cash squeeze, it became clear what the only realistic ans=So two days later, Lay invited Watson to his River Oaks home near downtown =Houston for breakfast to discuss a deal. Over muffins and ``a bad cup of co=ffee'' the next day, Watson recalls, they sketched the outlines, and by 10 =p.m. that night, the investment bankers were called in. On Nov. 9, Dynegy a=nnounced that it would pay about $10 billion, plus the assumption of $13 bi=llion in debt, to buy Enron, which is nearly four times its size. The key t=o the deal was Dynegy's immediate $1.5 billion infusion of cash to shore up=Enron's balance sheet and save its credit rating. The money came from Dyne=gy's 26% owner, ChevronTexaco Corp.=20Without that help, Enron--the seventh-largest U.S. company, based on its $1=00 billion in sales last year--may well have faced bankruptcy. Watson says =that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams. ``=I don't think anybody foresaw the problems [at Enron],'' he says. ``It's be=en incredible to watch.''=20Watson, 51, has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment ye=t. If he can pull it off, the new Dynegy will have revenues of more than $2=00 billion and $90 billion in assets, including more than 22,000 megawatts =of power-generating capacity and 25,000 miles of pipeline. It would control=an estimated 20% to 25% of the energy-trading market, up from about 6% now=.=20That would be sweet vindication for Watson's strategy. Dynegy backs trading=operations with hard assets such as power plants, which allows the company=to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer. In contrast, Enron has wo=rked furiously to shed power plants and oil- and gas-generating fields, bel=ieving it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expert=ise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel, pulp, and pap=er. IRRESISTIBLE BARGAIN. As Enron's stock slid below $9 from its August, 2=000, high of $90, it became a bargain that Watson couldn't pass up. It woul=d have taken years for Dynegy to build up a market-making operation to matc=h Enron's. Its risk-management systems are top-of-the-line. Enron's commerc=ial-services unit, which manages power supplies for corporate customers suc=h as Wendy's International Inc., is three or four years ahead of Dynegy's, =says Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy. Watson says he still plans to ge=t rid of the $8 billion worth of assets Lay had earmarked for sale, includi=ng the Portland (Ore.) General Electric plant and oil and gas assets in Ind=ia. For the $1.5 billion, though, if the deal falls through Dynegy will hav=e the right to Enron's prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline, worth an estim=ated $2.25 billion. And Dynegy can walk away if Enron's legal liabilities e=xceed $3.5 billion.=20Watson firmly believes that Enron suffered from a crisis of confidence, not=a meltdown of its core business. Indeed, Enron's wholesale-trading operati=ooked under the hood, and guess what? It's just as strong as we thought it =was.''=20But the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by Enron's accounting=tricks. The biggest danger for Watson is that there are other time bombs t=icking away. Already, the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1=997 by $591 million, or 20% of its total, to account for controversial part=nerships involving Enron officials.

If not? The massive ear=nings boost provides ``a high margin of error,'' he says. A WANNABE. Of cou=rse, regulators may object to the concentration of trading operations.

Dynegy's operations are m=ore conservative; some compare it to a fraternity. Dynegy's decision to iss=ue new stock options to some Enron employees may soothe battered egos.

Here's what companies should do-=-and what investors need to knowBy Nanette Byrnes and David Henry=20With Mike McNamee in Washington11/26/2001BusinessWeek76(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)In an age when giant earnings write-offs have become commonplace, it's hard=to shock Wall Street. But on Nov. 8, Enron Corp. managed to do it. After y=ears of high-octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24% a year=, the Houston-based energy company acknowledged that results for the past t=hree years were actually overstated by more than a half-billion dollars. It=was confirmation of investors' worst fears. Three weeks earlier, Enron had=announced a big drop in shareholders' equity, sparking fears that its hide=ously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance. Ma=nagement pointed to a number of factors, including a dubious decision to ex=clude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a=billion-dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company's=net worth.=20Enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far sho=rt of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases, b=ut it is hardly alone. This year, Corporate America is expected to charge o=ff a record $125 billion, much of it for assets, investments, and inventory=that aren't worth as much as management thought (chart, page 79). Even if =companies don't go back and restate earnings, as Enron is doing, those char=ges cast doubt on the record-breaking earnings growth of the late '90s.Not since the 1930s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issu=e--and so difficult for investors to determine. There's more at stake than =the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers. If eve=n the most sophisticated financial minds can't figure out what a company ac=tually earns, that has implications far beyond Enron. U.S. financial market=s have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build. It has made t=he U.S. the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place =to invest. It has also ensured ready access to capital for U.S. corporation=s. That a company such as Enron, a member of the Standard & Poor's 500-stoc=k index and one of the largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange, co=uld fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnish=ed. ``The profession of auditing and accounting is, in fact, in crisis,'' s=ays Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now one of =the leaders of the International Accounting Standards Board.=20Sometimes, as in the case of Enron, fuzzy numbers result from questionable =decisions in figuring net earnings. More often, though, the earnings chaos =results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in the=ir own idiosyncratic ways--and an increasing willingness among investors an=d analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies, which appear under a variet=y of names, from ``pro forma'' to ``core.'' (Enron offers its own such vers=ion. Before investors untangled the importance of Enron's first announcemen=t, its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ``recurring ne=t income'' had met expectations.) The resulting murk makes it difficult to =Why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place? Because the numb=ers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are=woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a co=mpany's prospects. Many institutional investors, most Wall Street analysts,=and even many accountants say GAAP is irrelevant. ``I don't know anyone wh=o uses GAAP net income anymore for anything,'' says Lehman Brothers Inc. ac=counting expert Robert Willens. The problem is that GAAP includes a lot of =noncash charges and one-time expenses. While investors need to be aware of =those charges, they also need a number that pertains solely to the performa=nce of ongoing operations.=20That's what operating earnings are supposed to do. But because they're calc=ulated in an ad hoc manner, with each company free to use its own rules, co=mparisons between companies have become meaningless. ``No investor--certain=ly not any ordinary investor--can read these in a way that's useful,'' says=Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. The SEC =is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and =perhaps restrict use of pro formas.=20What's badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings an=d a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income. In the end, in=vestors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited ne=t-income number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the othe=r. ``OUT OF HAND.'' A widespread consensus is building to do just that. In =early November, S&P proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when ta=llying operating earnings. Only the week before, the Financial Accounting S=tandards Board, the rulemakers for GAAP, had announced that they, too, woul=d be taking up this issue. Volcker says the International Accounting Standa=rds Board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings.=20``Over the past two or three years, the use of creative earnings measures h=as grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of=hand,'' says David M. Blitzer, S&P's chief investment strategist. ``Earnin=gs are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they're trying to=evaluate a company. If people want to use an operating-earnings measure, w=e better all know what we're looking at.''=20Without those standards in place, the gap between earnings according to gen=erally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to Wall Street=is only going to grow wider and more confusing. Look at the variance in ea=.78 according to Wall Street analysts as tallied by Thomson Financial/First=Call, $9.17 according to S&P, and $6.37 according to numbers reported to t=he SEC under GAAP. (S&P, like BusinessWeek, is owned by The McGraw-Hill Com=panies.)=20The lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong. Use=First Call's earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively =modest price-earnings ratio of 23 for the S&P 500. But run the numbers usin=g GAAP earnings, and suddenly the market has a far steeper p-e of 38.=20How did we get into this mess? Investors and analysts have been calculating=operating earnings for years, and for years, reasonable people could more =or less agree on how to do it. Then came the dot-com bubble, along with inc=reased pressure from Wall Street for companies to meet their quarterly earn=ings forecasts. Suddenly, companies that hadn't turned a profit by any conv=entional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants. Th=ese customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and a=llowed upstart companies to show a profit. ``TOWER OF BABEL.'' Pro forma fo=rmulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter=within the same company, casting doubt on their validity. And these days, =the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever. S&=o forma, but they aren't followed widely enough to be a standard. ``Investo=rs are facing a Tower of Babel,'' says Robert K. Elliott, former chief of t=he American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and a retired=KPMG partner. ``It's not standardized, and the numbers are not audited.''==20That makes it tough to evaluate a company's performance. In the quarter end=ed on Sept. 30, Nortel Networks Corp. offered shareholders at least three e=arnings numbers to choose from. By conservative GAAP accounting, the teleco=mmunications giant lost $1.08 a share. The company also provided two possib=cluding some acquisition costs and restructuring charges, and a still bette=r 27 cents loss that further excluded $1.9 billion of ``incremental charges=,'' such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivab=les. Wall Street chose the rosiest one.=20Confusing? You bet. Companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointi=asure that gives them better insight into their company's future. The goal =is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for th=ose operations. ``There are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operat=ing earnings,'' says Volcker. ``It is an effort to provide some continuity =and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company.'' Besides, a=s companies like to point out, they still have to report GAAP earnings, and=investors are free to ignore everything else.=20There's no starker lesson in the shortcomings of GAAP than the $50 billion =asset write-downs by JDS Uniphase Corp., the biggest charge of the year. Ne=ar the height of the telecom bull market in July, 2000, the San Jose (Calif=.) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor =SDL Inc. for $41 billion in stock. When the deal closed in February, its as=sets ballooned from $25 billion to $65 billion. But by then, shares of JDS =and other fiber-optics makers were collapsing. To bring its acquisitions in=to line with their new value, the company took charges of $50 billion. Desp=ite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions an=d involved no cash paid, GAAP required that the charges be taken out of net=income. So according to GAAP, JDS lost $56 billion in the fiscal year endi=ng in June--a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past =five years added up to only $5 billion.=20Analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash, the charge-=off was all about the past, a right-sizing of values that had gotten out of=hand. To analyze the company's prospects, they excluded the $50 billion ch=arge. ``The accounting is not designed to make things look better but to de=scribe what happened,'' says JDS Uniphase Chief Financial Officer Anthony R=. Muller, ``and we'll live with the consequences, whatever they are.'' Anal=ysts make a similar defense. ``My goal is to figure out what the business i=s going to produce so that we can value the company,'' says Lehman Brothers=analyst Arnab Chanda. GLACIAL PACE. Are JDS's pro forma numbers realistic-=-a fair gauge of JDS's ongoing operations? Right now, it's hard for investo=rs to judge. And that's the kind of ambiguity S&P and others would like to =eliminate. In November, S&P circulated a memo on how to standardize operati=ng earnings. Under the proposal, operating earnings would include the costs=of purchases, research and development, restructuring costs (including sev=erance), write-downs from ongoing operations, and the cost to the company o=f stock options. It would exclude merger-and-acquisition expenses, impairme=nt of goodwill, litigation settlements, and the gain or loss on the sale of=an asset.=20When S&P applied roughly that formula to JDS Uniphase, it split the differe=nce between Wall Street and GAAP. Because of differences in what each group=included in their earnings calculations, the results were chaotic. Using G=AAP, the company lost $9.39 a share. S&P figures it lost $3.19, while the c=ompany put the loss at 36 cents. Meanwhile, Wall Street says it made 2 cent=s.=20inancial Accounting Standards Board, the group in charge of GAAP? Chairman =Edmund L. Jenkins says FASB will be addressing the problems. Still, investo=rs shouldn't expect any improvement soon. The pace of change at FASB tends =to be glacial. It typically takes four years to complete a new standard. In=1996, for example, the board realized that standards on restructuring char=ges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda. =In June, 2000, the board finally issued a draft of a new standard, asked fo=r comments, and held a public hearing. In October, 2001, the board said it =still wasn't ready to put a fix in place. Now, the recession has set off an=other wave of restructuring charges, and the FASB still doesn't have new ru=les.=20The slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden =changes in the market. The most recent failure followed the terrorist attac=ks on September 11. An FASB task force, unable to come up with a set of rul=es for separating September 11 costs from general expenses, instead told co=mpanies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item. So=GAAP earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a compan=y's general performance. Many companies have nevertheless broken those cost=s out in their unaudited press releases.=20Many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter. Indeed, 2001 is shapin=g up to be one for the record books. A poor economy and the devastating aft=ereffects of September 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that a=re unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen. But there's a gro=wing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide=missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time char=ges. The temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now, while =investors are braced for bad news. Not only can managers sweep away yesterd=ay's errors, but tomorrow's earnings will look even better.=20The basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a char=ge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to di=stort the truth about a company's performance. Usually, big charges fall in=to a few categories, including charges for laying off workers and restructu=ring a company, charges for assets that have lost value since they were pur=chased, charges for investments that have lost value, and charges for inven=tory that has become obsolete. In a recent study, Harvard Business School p=rofessor Mark T. Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling the=se charges unusual. That gives them a rationale for excluding them from the=ir pro forma calculations.=20Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part =of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company's earnings histo=ry. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real s=hareholder wealth that's been lost,'' argues David W. Tice, manager of the =Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that's up 17% so f=ar this year. ``It's money they spent on something no longer worth what it =was, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. =Whatever the reason, it's a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareh=olders.'' Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings c=an obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate opera=ting earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best po=ssible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, =tails you lose'' school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains=in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in=its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the incom=e statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer=maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell =spokesman Michael Maher says the company's press releases and SEC filings b=reak out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In=our view, the numbers are reported clearly,'' says Maher. ``It's all out t=here for the consuming public.'' PAST PUFFERY. Many experts believe special=charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated. What should inve=stors make of a company such as Gateway Inc.? Two restructuring charges in =the first and third quarters, minus a small extraordinary gain, totaled $1.=12 billion, or about $100 million more than the company made in 1998, 1999,=and 2000 combined. Which is the truer picture of its performance and poten=tial? The write-offs or the earnings? Write-offs for customer financing are=another example. When Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to=customers by $767 million in September, it effectively admitted it had boo=ked sales in the past to companies that couldn't pay--in effect overstating=its performance in those earlier periods. In addition, Nortel says booking=sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues. Tech companies blame=the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write-offs. And these are=n't isolated examples. Peter L. Bernstein, publisher of newsletter Economic=s & Portfolio Strategy, found that from 1989 to 1993, 20% of earnings vanis=hed into write-offs.=20Big charge-offs can also distort future performance. Critics contend that e=xcess reserves are often used as a sort of ``cookie jar'' from which earnin=gs can be taken in future quarters to meet Wall Street's expectations. Or c=harges taken this year, for example, which is apt to be a lousy one for mos=t companies anyway, might include costs that would otherwise have been take=n in future periods. Prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earni=ngs. Rules for figuring operating earnings would help, but this is an area =that will always involve a certain amount of judgment--and therefore invite=a certain amount of abuse. ``People are going to write off everything they=can in the next two quarters because they're having a bad year anyway,'' s=ays Robert G. Atkins, a Mercer Management consultant.=20Part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug the=m off, believing that with the bad news out in the open, the company is poi=sed for a brighter future. Since Gateway detailed its third-quarter charge =of $571 million on Oct. 18, Wall Street has bid the stock up 48%, compared =with a 6% runup for the S&P 500.=20Often, though, investors should take exactly the opposite message. If, for =example, part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training, infor=mation-technology spending, or research and development, the cuts could dep=ress future performance, says Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at the =Stern School of Business at New York University. ``Are these really one-tim=e events?'' he asks. ``Or is this the beginning of an avalanche?'' Indeed, =Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. strategist Steve Galbraith has found that =in the year following a big charge-off to earnings companies have underperf=ormed the stock market by 20 percentage points. ``LA LA LAND.'' Investors a=re apt to be faced with more huge write-offs next year, even if the economy=doesn't continue to worsen. Why? The transition to a new GAAP rule that ch=anges the way companies account for goodwill--a balance-sheet asset that re=flects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangibl=e assets. Under the new rule, companies will have to assess their propertie=s periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value=falls. An informal survey by Financial Executives International of its mem=ber controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect t=o take more charges.=20But figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task. Unless t=here is a comparable company or factory with an established market price, v=aluing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules. =``What this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors com=ing up with their own tests for impairment,'' says the Stern School's Profe=ssor Paul R. Brown. ``It's La La Land.''=20While the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings gam=es, it could also be an impetus for change--especially in the wake of the d=ot-com fiasco. Indeed, there are some signs of a backlash. The real estate =investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings, with its ``=funds from operations,'' or FFO. But now some REITs have begun to revert to=plain old GAAP earnings. Hamid R. Moghadam, CEO of San Francisco-based AMB=Property Corp., shifted back to GAAP in 1999. ``The reason I don't like FF=O is very simple,'' says Moghadam. ``One company's numbers look better than=another one's even if they had identical fundamental results.''=20There are other steps FASB could take to improve financial reporting and re=store GAAP's status. Trevor S. Harris, an accounting expert at Morgan Stanl=ey, says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income=from operations and income from financial transactions. Lehman's Willens s=ays companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they=bear on earnings. An easy step would be to require companies to file their=press releases with the SEC.=20At the least, says Lev, companies must clearly explain how their pro forma =numbers relate to the GAAP numbers. Otherwise, he says, investors ``see num=bers floating there, and where did they come from?'' In today's environment=of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write-offs, no questio=n is more important to investors.High-Gloss GlossaryCompanies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin =onNET INCOMEThe bottom line, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAA=P).Sometimes called ``reported earnings,'' these are the numbers the Securitie=s &Exchange Commission accepts in its filings.OPERATING EARNINGSAn adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrela=tedto the ongoing business.

James Lam, founder of eRisk, a consulting firm.==20As an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of man=agement of price risks, I have been an admirer of Enron's elaborate disclos=ure of its risk management practices. And yet, in a cascade of events over =a period of just three weeks from mid-October, it lost two-thirds of its sh=are value, became the subject of a US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) =investigation, and was taken over by a rival a third in size. (Latest repor=ts create some doubt about whether this will go through.) What went wrong?No, the events had nothing to do with Dabhol. Indeed, if, for us in India, =Enron will always be associated with the controversial power project, elsew=here it is likely become a case study for students of accounting, finance a=nd general management. (On second thoughts, even its Indian adventures woul=d make an excellent case study!)=20But first, a recount of what happened. After announcing on October 16, with=out much explanation or transparency, that it has taken a charge of $ 1.2 b=illion against equity, Enron's share price started tumbling. Apparently, th=e charge was the result of some financial transactions, and the SEC launche=d an investigation. The chief financial officer (CFO), who was directly inv=olved with the transactions, the company's treasurer and a couple of other =senior officials were sacked.=20Perhaps most damagingly, Enron revised its accounts from 1997 onwards, redu=cing profits by about $ 600 million and increasing debt by a somewhat simil=ar amount. As a result, Enron's credit rating was downgraded.=20It seems the root problem was not in its basic business of power and gas tr=ading, but in its investment activities controlled by the CFO. These compri=sed private equity, and Enron's share in each of the investee companies was=kept artificially below 50 per cent to avoid consolidation of accounts. To=this end, outside investors were brought in and assured of equity in Enron=itself, should the value of the investee company(ies) fall below agreed th=reshold(s).=20All this was done to keep the losses in investments off-balance sheet, and =mitigate their impact on reported profits. Many other US corporations inclu=ding J P Morgan Chase, which had large private equity investments, have suf=fered on this score (see World Money October 15). Enron wanted to avoid thi=s and, last year, paid its since-dismissed CFO $ 30 million for his creativ=e accounting genius.=20Incidentally, those enamoured of US GAAP and its alleged superiority over t=he rest of the world should note that all these gimmicks were blessed by th=e company's auditors one of the Big Five firms, which was paid $ 25 million=as audit fees and $ 27 million for other services by Enron last year.=20The restatement of the accounts from 1997 onwards became necessary as the E=nron management/board and the auditors were forced, on review, to admit tha=t at least some of the transactions should have been on, rather than off, b=alance sheet. Details of all the transactions in question are yet to come o=ut, but what has come out is bad enough.=20But this apart, a billion dollar hit for a company of the size ($ 300 billi=on) or cash flow ($ 3 billion) of Enron is, by itself, hardly a death warra=nt.

The project is miredin a tariff dispute over $64 million in bills that haven't beenpaid by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its onlycustomer, for eight months.``One more bidder will increase competition, which iswelcome.``Any step in the national interest is good.``Cheap energy is always in the national interest since wewant to increase electricity generation and sell it at areasonable price.``I can't comment on the time-frame of buying out the Enronstake until the legal wrangles are solved.

"---------------------- Forwarded by Jennifer Rudolph/HOU/EES on 05/07/2001Susan J Mara@ENRONThis morning Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett held a press conference on her AB128x.  Several print journalists and 3 TV cameras were present at theconference.  Also of interest is that the Senate tax consultants and Burton'sstaff were at the event.  Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson showed up lateand gave a few quotes to the media present.  A spokesman from Mirant alsogave a few interviews after the press conference.According to Corbett's staff, they expect to handout the bill amendments atthe hearing.""This bill is not a negotiating tool.  I'm very serious about this bill.  Iwant to see it through the process.  The Governor will sign a bill like this.""The following amendments are to be presented at the committee hearing todayAB 128X1) Creates a Tax on Excess Gross Receipts from Electrical EnergyDistribution (called a ""tax on excess greed"")2) Imposes a tax on the first sale of electricity by generators andmiddlemen.3) Establishes as the measure for the tax, the amount by which thegross receipts exceed a specified price (""the base price"").  The measure oftax is called the excess gross receipts.a) Sales price more than the base price but not more than 150%of the base price, tax rate = 50%b) Sales price more than 150% of the base price but not morethan 200% of the base price, tax rate = 70%c) Sales price more than 200% of the base price, tax rate = 90%5) Creates a rebuttable presumption that the base price represents afair sales price.6)  Adds a mechanism to require withholding of the tax by purchasers.Residential consumers and small business are exempt.7)  Requires sellers to file annual tax returns to report the tax on excessgross receipts and pay any remaining tax due.8)  The measure sunsets after five (5) years.There will be a report after today's Assembly Rev & Tax Cmte hearing.As opposed to SB 1x that returns the taxes raised to ratepayers, AB 128xwould ""repay"" the State's General Fund.Chris Micheli, Esq.Carpenter Snodgrass & Associates1201 K Street, Suite 710Sacramento, CA  95814(916) 447-2251",ca.team@enron.com,jennifer.rudolph@enron.com,Windfall Profits Tax,True

Allow VEPCO to buy the plant from us at a fixed price at the end of theterm of the PPA (around $425/kW).This structure caps our downside risk into a quantifiable number (it alsolimits our upside but we're willing to give that up to protect against a bignegative hit).In order to evaluate this structure, VEPCO has asked for some specific plantinformation.  We have most of this info in various forms and I would likeyour help pulling it together.1).  Full plant description (equipment, design, drawings)2).

"jeff.dasovich@enron.comjeff.dasovich@enron.comFrom additional conversations with the Ed Duncan and Mike Day --It looks as if WE ARE REQUIRED TO SEEK A STAY/REQUEST FOR REHEARING FROM THE CPUC BEFORE WE CAN FILE WITH THE COURTS.    We also have to include ALL our points in the CPUC filing or we CANNOT bring them up with the courts.To be able to get to court ASAP, we will want to file Friday AM, presuming a Thursday pm vote for a July 1 or other retro date.That means we need to line up all the joint parties AND get them to file declarations identifying their ""irreparable harm"".I am working with Jeremy Blachman to see if can get some customers to sign on and with other ESPs -- I have a few who have agreed so far.The attorney is preparing pro-forma declarations that each company/customer would file under protective seal.  We need to identify who at Enron would be filing this and get it going.  Arter and Hadden is preparing a draft as we speak and I'll be able to get it out right away.Meanwhile, Dan Douglass will be working on preparing the CPUC filing, which will be developed from the court pleading we were working on.Please let me know ASAP.SueMara(415) 782-7802.I am attaching the Joint Petition which assumes that a direct access customer joins Enron.The draft is considerably improved over the draft sent yesterday but it does not take in the comments below.  These will be reviewed and integrated into the next draft.I am very concerned about the exhaustion of remedies problem.  The jurisdictional statute is PUC section 1768(a).  This provision suggests that an aggrieved party must seek a rehearing before the PUC before seeking review by the Supreme Court.  A request for rehearing must be made within 15 days after the PUC acts, but there is no time within which the PUC must act.  If the PUC agreed to stay the Order, then it seems clear that a rehearing must be sought before applying to the Supreme Court.  If the PUC refuses the stay request, then there is a good argument that one of the exceptions to the exhaustion of remedies would apply.  This will require that one or all of the Petitioners request a stay by the PUC.  Douglass indicates that a stay would be unusual and that such requests normally are not made.  In this case, it is probably necessary to circumvent the exhaustion issue.  EWDSue --I have reviewed the Petition and associated Memorandum.  A couple of general1.  We make the point throughout (page 2 is the first time) that theCommission's action (retroactive suspension) will result in a windfall tothe UDCs as they will be paid for services provided by Enron and other ESPs.It is not clear to me that we can make this argument.  The commission'sorder does not indicate that the ESPs have to pay the UDCs the amounts thatthey have received from their direct access customers for the past twomonths for energy procurement.  The commission could just as easily decidethat although customers who entered into DA contracts after July 1 are nolonger allowed to continue on DA, they will not go  back and undotransactions that have already occurred.2.   In the section of the memorandum discussing why the petition isproperly before the court (Section IV), we are discussing why an applicationfor rehearing is unnecessary.  We state that in this case a rehearing wouldbe superfluous and unnecessary as ""there are no new legal arguments and noadditional evidence to be presented.""  Such argument appears to run counterto our contentions that because of the lack of hearing in this proceeding,the Commission's decision lacks the support it needs or, on the flip side,denied us the opportunity to put on evidence to show the suspension ofdirect access was unnecessary.3.  In section VI. (e) of the Memorandum arguing that the impairment ofcontracts ordered by the Commission is not reasonable or appropriate, westate that the Commission's motive is not the announced purpose, that itspurpose instead is malevolent as illustrated by the rhetoric directed at outof state energy  companies.  I don't think such an argument adds anythingand, although it maybe true, at this stage it probably is not a good idea toassert that the Commission is purposely hurting the state to get back at theout of state energy companies.Jeanne.jdasovic@enron.com; jsteffe@enron.com; rshapiro@enron.com.Attached is the revised Petition and Points and Authorities (the Sept. 8Draft"").  This draft has not been redlined because the changes and additionsare extensive.  Future revisions will be redlined.This draft will be revised to clarify the arguments, toi nclude pagereferences to the exhibits, to include missing authorities, and to eliminatetypos, etc.The argument is that the Commission acted contrary to state and federalconstitutional guaranties (a de novo standard of review) and that theCommission acted in excess of its authority and contrary to law therebyabusing its discretion (a substantial evidence standard of review).You will be provided a revised draft by noon on Monday (Sept 10) which Ianticipate will be substantially complete.

"Hunter,IHSWe met with IHS this morning to discuss the data that we need to complete our supply forecasts.  It is our intent to use the monthly historical production data in combination with well completion data, rig counts, and drilling permits to build a more accurate production forecast.  We need complete well characteristic data (depth, basin, age) in order to be accurate.US Production data - monthly volumes from all wells in the US updated on a lag of 1-6 months - $159,500/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthlyUS Well data - well characteristics updated monthly, data age is only limited by CD-ROM delivery - $154,000/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthlyNext year, we will be able to cut the US Well data and add Scout Express, which will cut the cost by $115,500.  Scout Express has only one year of historical well data, so it does not currently meet our needs.

Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts.Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to ""help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record"".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying ""show me"" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were.Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said ""FERC--just get it done""....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the ""there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree...""Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.

The VaR calculation forour model is for a one day holding period which means that your risk factorwill be reduced by a factor equal the sqrt(5) or 2.24.Old risk factor (%) =  1.65*(std of the price movement) = 3.99%New daily risk factor = 3.99/2.24  = 1.78%    which actually equates to stdof approx 1.1% a day.I am happy with this as a estimate of the vol as the annualized spot vol weare showing for Cu is approx 19% which equates to approx 1.2% daily.Using this new risk factor for the daily VaR the Cu positions would give aVaR (for the 19th) of approx $2m which is less that thefigure we estimated ($3,100,568).The other thing is that by taking net numbers we are disregarding the termstructure of the price curve/vol curve and positioncurve and are hence collapsing everything into a one factor model which meansthat it is difficult to compare the numbers.I hope that this helps to explain our number.Hopefully we can talk tomorrow,CheersKirstee",Andreas.Barschkis@mgusa.com,vince.kaminski@enron.com,VaR numbers for the 26th,False

Californians resented the energy trading company's huge profits during th=eir energy crisis, and Democrats in Washington raised questions about Enron='s influence within the White House and about the cozy relationship between=Enron's chairman, Kenneth Lay, and Vice President Dick Cheney. Nobody seem=ed better positioned to thrive during the Bush presidency than this Houston=-based apostle of deregulation.=20Wall Street was impressed with Enron's strategy of swooping into formerly r=egulated markets to broker contracts for natural gas, electricity or unused=telecom bandwidth. The company was celebrated as a paragon of American ing=enuity, a stodgy gas pipeline company that had reinvented itself as a high-=tech clearinghouse in an ever-expanding roster of markets. Enron's push to =force utilities into the Internet age with its online trading systems, at a=seemingly handsome profit, became an epic tale of the dot-com revolution.It now appears that Enron's tale may be more cautionary than epic. Enron en=vy has crashed, along with the company's stock price, as serious questions =emerge about its bookkeeping. Enron disclosed earlier this month that $1.2 =billion in market value had vanished as a result of a controversial deal it=entered into with private partnerships run by its chief financial officer,=Andrew Fastow.=20Most alarming was Enron's reluctance to shed light on management's wheeling=and dealing. ''Related-party transactions,'' as the accountants call them,=are fraught with conflicts of interest. Though much remains to be learned =about these transactions, their scope and lack of transparency suggest that=Enron may have in effect created its own private hedge fund to assume some=of the risk and mask the losses of its complex trading. The extent to whic=h company insiders profited from the partnerships is not yet clear.=20Enron has scrambled to dampen Wall Street's concerns, acknowledging its cre=dibility problem while insisting on the health of its core businesses. On W=ednesday it brought in William Powers, the dean of the University of Texas =School of Law, to review the transactions. The Securities and Exchange Comm=ission has launched its own formal investigation. Mr. Fastow was forced to =resign, following Jeffrey Skilling, the man credited with driving Enron int=o new cutting-edge businesses, out the door.=20Enron's former admirers on Wall Street, mindful of recent scandals involvin=g high-profile companies doctoring their earnings, and of the spectacular c=ollapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998, are alarmed=. Carole Coale of Prudential Securities summed up the prevailing sentiment =ommend an investment when management does not disclose facts.'' Analysts, a=s well as the media, are not entirely blameless. Enron did mention, albeit =in passing, the troubling related-party deals as early as March 2000. But f=ew analysts bothered to raise questions at a time when the company's revenu=es, profits and stock price were soaring.=20Harvey Pitt, the new Securities and Exchange Commissioner, must pursue the =Enron inquiry aggressively in order to assure investors that he will be as =vigilant as his predecessor, Arthur Levitt, when it comes to protecting the=integrity of financial markets. Indeed, even if Enron is cleared of any wr=ongdoing and regains some of its past luster, as it well might, the company=that preaches the merits of self-regulating marketplaces has reminded us a=ll of the need for a strong regulator on Wall Street.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09NOVEMBER 12, 2001=20FINANCE=20Business WeekThe Enron DebacleByzantine deals have shattered the energy outfit's credibilityExecutives at high-flying Enron Corp. (ENE ) never seemed overly concerned =with how the rest of the world viewed their business practices. Earlier thi=s year, the California Attorney General had to get a court order to collect=documents in an industrywide investigation into energy price fixing. And w=hen an analyst challenged former CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling in a conference ca=ll to produce Enron's balance sheet, Skilling called him an ""ass----."" Stil=l, even some Enron executives worried that the company had gone too far wit=h two complex partnerships set up in 1999 to buy company assets and hedge i=nvestments. With Enron's then-chief financial officer acting as general man=ager of the partnerships and in a position to personally benefit from their=investments, the potential for a conflict of interest and backlash from in=vestors seemed overwhelming. ""Internally, everybody said this is not a good=idea,"" says a source close to the company.But no one could have predicted such a jaw-dropping outcome for the nation'=s largest and most innovative energy trader. Since Oct. 16, when Enron reve=aled a $35 million charge to earnings to reflect losses on those partnershi=ps and was forced to knock $1.2 billion off its shareholders' equity, the c=ompany's stock has plunged 60%. The Securities & Exchange Commission is inv=estigating Enron's accounting for its partnerships and whether it properly =disclosed them to investors.Suddenly the company, which brought high-tech and complex finance to energy=trading, is essentially trying to avoid a run on the bank. Moody's Investo=rs Service has already downgraded the company's debt. Enron says it is meet=ing with credit agencies to calm their fears, and analysts say Enron is wor=king on a turnaround plan that would likely include accelerating asset sale=s, issuing shares, and obtaining new credit lines. Enron's board has set up=a special committee to look into its controversial partnerships. But analy=sts also worry that Enron's trading partners could pull the plug if they lo=se confidence that it can honor its trades.""ON CRACK?"" Inside Enron, once-cocky employees are reeling. They were still=puzzling over the abrupt Aug. 14 departure of CEO Skilling when the compan=y announced on Oct. 24 that CFO Andrew S. Fastow, architect of the controve=rsial private LJM investments--which got their name from the first initials=of his wife and children--was removed from his post and on leave. In a ten=se meeting held at a Houston hotel after the latest financial disclosures, =soft-spoken Chairman and CEO Kenneth L. Lay faced 1,600 employees, with ano=ther 5,000 hooked up via the Web. One irate worker asked if he was ""on crac=k."" Lay, an economist by training, turned over day-to-day management in 199=7. Until Skilling quit, citing personal reasons unrelated to Enron, Lay was=talking about retirement, sources say. Now he is facing his biggest fight =ever. ""Ken is looking at a 30-year career of accomplishment going down in f=lames. This is just awful,"" says one friend.On the surface, at least, Enron's off-balance-sheet maneuvering hardly seem=s the stuff that would crater a company. Amazingly, sources close to Enron =claim that one rationale for Fastow's deals was to save an estimated $30 mi=llion a year in investment-banking fees. Fastow's involvement in the partne=rships, which bought assets from Enron, including stakes in telecom and ene=rgy, was supposed to make the deals simpler for the investment bankers and =thus cheaper. They were also meant, according to sources close to the compa=ny, to hedge Enron's investments in potentially risky assets while allowing=it to maintain some control over them. Enron says Fastow made money for hi=mself on some of the deals, but insiders insist there were less controversi=al ways to enrich him if that were the aim. Fastow did not return calls see=king comment. Lay, who declined to comment for this story, has said that th=e partnerships were properly vetted by Enron's attorneys and internal and e=xternal auditors and were approved by its board. A source familiar with Enr=But whatever Enron's reasons for creating the LJM partnerships, the problem=s were compounded by scanty disclosure. The deals were first revealed in a =1999 proxy, raising concerns from investors and analysts. By this summer, w=hen Enron's stock was falling and its bets in broadband were souring, compl=aints about LJM grew louder. So in June, Fastow pulled out of the partnersh=ips. When the write-offs came, Enron enraged analysts and investors further=by failing to disclose the hit to equity in its third-quarter earnings pre=ss release. Instead, Lay mentioned it in a conference call with analysts. ""=We found it disconcerting that the company waited to disclose the additiona=l $1.2 billion charge to equity in a fleeting comment in the middle of its =conference call,"" says UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone.BAD BETS. Still, Enron's credibility did not vanish overnight. Analysts hav=e been lobbying for years for more information about how and where Enron ma=kes its money in its often byzantine trading business. While the company's =revenues were soaring from $9.2 billion in 1995 to $100.8 billion in 2000 a=nd its stock was returning 500% during the same six-year period, Enron's ag=gressive, even arrogant managers could ignore Wall Street's complaints with=impunity. But after its stock price collapsed this year (chart), the compa=ny's attitude and operational missteps quickly caught up. And there was ple=nty to worry about. The company's $3 billion power plant in India wasn't pa=ying its bills amid a political controversy; its highly ballyhooed business=for trading high-speed communications capacity was crippled by the telecom=industry meltdown; and its calamitous foray into the water business with A=zurix Corp. has already cost Enron at least $574 million in write-offs.These bad bets and the expensive LJM shock have investors worried about wha=t else might be lurking at Enron. Many aren't sticking around to find out. =""I think the lack of disclosure on their financial engineering killed the c=redibility of the management team,"" says Richard A. Giesen, who manages the=Munder Power Plus fund, which dumped its Enron shares about a month ago.It's not clear just how many off-balance-sheet financing vehicles Enron has=used over time. Some were created years ago to finance oil and gas produce=rs. Analysts and sources close to the deals say there's no particular risk =in these to Enron shareholders. Other interconnected entities, such as Whit=ewing, Osprey, Atlantic Water Trust, and Marlin Water Trust, were a way to =get assets no longer central to Enron's strategy off its balance sheet, fre=eing capital and credit for the core energy business and ventures like broa=dband (table).To entice institutional investors such as pension funds and insurers into t=hese deals, Enron promised to kick in equity if asset sales weren't enough =to cover debt. Such ""mandatory equity"" deals have been used by at least a h=alf-dozen others in the energy and telecom industries, including El Paso (E=PG), Williams, and Dominion, says Standard & Poor's director Todd A.

""Nobody's going to find anything that's particularly unique or below boa=rd"" in such deals, says one investment banker specializing in the energy bu=siness.Worst case, which Shipman considers unlikely, Enron could be on the hook fo=r about $3 billion in its mandatory-equity deals.

Fastow's LJM, a private equity fund, was a different kind of anim=al, according to sources familiar with the arrangements. It bought energy a=nd other assets from Enron, which booked gains and losses on those deals. L=JM was also involved in complex hedging that was supposed to reduce the vol=atility of some of Enron's investments, including stakes in high-tech and t=elecom businesses and an interest in New Power Co., which markets power to =consumers. When Enron terminated these deals in September, it took the $1.2=billion hit to equity.But the more immediate question is whether trading partners will stick with=the company. The first place that might show up is in Enron's highly succe=ssful online platform, which trades everything from gas and electricity to =weather derivatives. To reassure its partners, Enron is scrambling to shore=up its liquidity. It has already tapped $3 billion in credit lines and is =trying to arrange another $1 billion. Shipman says he has seen no signs of =massive customer defections or drastically worsened credit terms. Still, ri=val traders are wary. ""We certainly have taken a closer look at Enron in th=e last week to 10 days and will continue to manage the credit risk, but we'=re still doing business with the company as usual,"" says Keith G. Stamm, CE=O of power and gas trader Aquila Inc. (ILA )""SPEEDING TRAIN."" Still, with the stock battered and rating agencies consid=ering further downgrades, that could rapidly change. In recent days, the un=certainty about Enron's future has reduced investors' appetite for Enron de=bt.

Morgan Chase& Co. and Citigroup Inc. last month to discuss ways to alleviate acash crunch. J.P. Morgan and Citigroup agreed to lend on thecondition that the Houston-based energy trader pledge twopipelines as collateral.Goldman's refusal highlights its reluctance to provide creditlines to all but its top fee-paying clients. By not lending toEnron, the firm also is able to advise companies that want to buyEnron or some of its assets, or make a bid of its own.For Enron, the decision makes it harder to resist the demandsof its existing lenders, who made the company give up collateraland pay higher interest rates to get its new loan.``People smell resistance to Enron,'' said Glenn Reynolds, ananalyst with CreditSights.com, an independent research firm. ``Thebalance of power is the with the banks now.''Kathleen Baum, a spokeswoman for Goldman, said the firm had``a long history of putting its capital to work for clients.'' Shewouldn't comment on the firm's relationship with Enron. KarenDenne, a spokeswoman for Enron, said, ``I won't confirm who wehave had talks with.''Shut OutEnron needed the $1 billion secured loan to supplement cashreserves and help the company pay off existing debt. Yesterday,Standard & Poor's cut Enron's long-term credit rating to ``BBB,''the second-lowest investment grade rating, from ``BBB+.''The SEC is investigating partnerships run by former ChiefFinancial Officer Andrew Fastow that bought and sold Enron sharesand assets. Those trades cost Enron $35 million. The company alsolost $1.2 billion in shareholder equity.Enron's dealings with the partnerships have shut it out ofcommercial-paper markets, where corporations borrow money for daysor weeks. Lenders are concerned that the company may have furtherlosses from its trading business.A week ago Enron tapped $3 billion in credit lines, arrangedby J.P. Morgan and Citibank, to pay off $2.2 billion in commercialpaper it has outstanding.Already loaded down with Enron debt, J.P. Morgan and Citibankforced Enron to pay as much as 2.5 percentage points more than theLondon interbank offered rate, or Libor, on its new loan,according to the people familiar with the matter. That's aboutfive times the spread Enron is paying on its existing lines,according to Bloomberg data.The extra yield wasn't sufficient incentive for Goldman tolend. Securities firms such as Goldman are required to valuelending commitments at market prices, exposing them to potentiallosses from declines in loan prices. Banks such as J.P. Morgan andCitibank are allowed to carry the assets at full value.Falling PricesEnron's existing loans have already fallen to between 80 and90 cents on the dollar since the company drew them down, accordingto traders.The company's 6.4 percent coupon notes due in 2006 fell asmuch as 6 cents on the dollar today, with price indicationsbetween 68 and 73 cents, traders said. Yesterday, traders bid forthe bonds at 74 cents and offered to sell them at 77 centsGoldman has been getting less investment-banking businessfrom Enron.The No. 3 U.S. securities firm by capital hasn't arranged abond sale for Enron since 1995, and Enron hasn't picked Goldman toadvise on an acquisition or sale since at least 1993, according toBloomberg data. The firm is a dealer on Enron's $3 billioncommercial paper program and has arranged six of the company's 15preferred share sales.Without a steady flow of investment banking fees, Goldman isreluctant to make loans that tie up capital in a business that isless profitable than advising on mergers or underwritingsecurities.second-largest automaker, and Vodafone Group Plc, Europe's largestcellular phone company.Goldman did extend $2 billion in credit to AT&T Corp. as partof a $25 billion credit facility last year. The largest U.S. long-distance phone company is one of the firm's most lucrativeclients, however, paying out more than $100 million in investment-banking fees during the past five years.After refusing to lend to Enron, Goldman is unlikely toadvise the energy trader on any of its planned $2.1 billion inasset sales, the people familiar said.J.P. Morgan is advising Enron on the sale of its Azurix NorthAmerican water business and may be retained, along withCitigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit, to look at other disposalsand a possible sale of the whole company, the people said.Goldman, which has an energy trading business of its own, mayalready be advising potential buyers of Enron's businesses, orlining up a bid of its own, Reynolds said.``We may well see Goldman pop up on the other side, whichwould explain its reticence to lend,'' he said.By Mark Golden11/02/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)A Dow Jones Newswires Column=20NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- With two outs in the bottom of the ninth and down by=two runs with one man on, Enron Corp.

"=20I wanted to send a note giving you my views on the NewCo opportunity and ne=xt steps.=20=20What are those opportunities?  In short, to date no competitor has taken En=ron's dominant market position.  In most cases, competitiors are retrenchin=g from an aggressive expansion of their deregulated business in order to pr=otect their key regulated franchises or balance sheets. Market liquidity an=d activity is extremely fractured and highly diminished from 2000 levels.  =This will create opportunities as bid/offers expand and customers have less=choices to manage key long-term risks. This lack of transparancy and liqui=dity will also provide numerous opportunities, in the commodity, asset and =capital markets, to take advantage of key arbitrages across the North Ameri=can grid.   We are faced with an energy asset overhang, in the short run, w=hich is unprecedented since the early nineties.  This coupled with market p=articipants selling assets to protect balance sheets will provide many oppo=rtunities to acquire attractive energy assets at good value. However, in th=e long-run, as we emerge from the recession and as highly energy intensive =technology investment resumes, increasing asset values, demand for energy a=nd energy price volatility are highly likely. On the services side, there a=re numerous un-met needs in the market place at this point including demand=side management, distributed generation amongst others that only Enron peo=ple have the complete value chain understanding to make feasible. I also be=lieve that innovation in the energy capital markets can provide value to Ne=wCo and our customers given the blight of liquidity in capital markets. In =short, we are at the eve of an opportunity in the energy markets which has =not been seen since the early nineties.=20What is NewCo?  NewCo will be a private company that will focus on the ener=gy merchant business in North America which will capitalize on the opportun=ities detailed above.  These businesses will stretch from production to mar=ket, wholesale through retail primarily in natural gas and electricity in t=he United States and Canada. It will be a portfolio of several key business=es, services and assets supported by a common infrastructure.  It will be m=ajority owned by Enron but will have significant outside investment to ensu=re liquidity and legitimacy. It will be re-branded and be operating and sol=vent by mid Q2 at the latest.  It will be seeded with a number of Enron ass=ets and contracts that we think add value to our business or provide key cr=edit support. Those assets are conservatively valued at approximately $500 =million to one billion. With asset and new cash investment, NewCo should be=at least a billion dollar company. It will emerge as a non-debtor company =and should be an investment grade rated company. NewCo will employ approxim=ately 100 to 200 people depending on the mix of businesses and assets under=control.  These people will be sourced from the existing pool of talent in=Enron and ex-employees. NewCo will have access to all Enron's existing sys=tems and infrastructure. It will be in the market of buying and selling ene=rgy albeit not market making which will be restricted under the non-compete=with Netco.I would expect that we would have a strong business and transac=tional relationship with Netco.=20What will be NewCo's culture? It will have the benefits of being a small pr=ivate company which will measure success by cashflow generation.  It will b=e a small company atmosphere where everyone knows each other.  It will be a=group that celebrates success together and works hard towards shared objec=tives.  It will have an attractive employee compensation plan particularily=for long term value creation.  We will build an organization of integrity =of which people can be proud. It will center its objectives around our cust=omers and the satisfying un-met needs in the market.  NewCo will value cust=omer relationships.  It will be a partnership and employ an atmosphere of o=pen communication. NewCo will be innovative, agile and nimble.=20ss issues, questions and comments.  There will also be a dinner set up for =nd additional social time to discuss NewCo. NewCo will be located on the 30=opportunity and business definiton including fully vetted business plans f=or opportunities identified around specific assets or independent of these =assets; b) setting up infrastructure necessary to cure defaults and start p=erforming to key operating assets including managing out of the bankruptcy;=c) modelling cashflows, operating costs, capital requirements and proforma='s for NewCo; d) working through the NewCo structure and path through bankr=uptcy to solvency, rating and operation; e) scouring Enron for other valuab=le assets not yet identified for NewCo; f) detailed market research;  g) as=set acquisition target definition; h) financing and capitalization plan inc=luding raising external investment and i) additional hiring and recruitment=.=20On a final note, we will need to identify a new name for the company so let=me know your ideas!

It gives them theability to change counterparties names after bridge back.Impact to Logistics - UnifyIf a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridgebacked, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty namewill flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place.One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in productionyet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths)This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially wherenominations were sent for entire month)can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safeguards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing.Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still causean additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in orderto get a clean quick response.What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes takeplace?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully Ican get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need toput some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow whenthese type of changes are needed.Will keep you posted.Thanks,dgHernandez/HOU/ECT@ECT, Julie Meyers/HOU/ECT@ECT, B Scott Palmer/HOU/ECT@ECT,Stephanie Sever/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dianne J Swiber/HOU/ECT@ECT, PeggyHedstrom/CAL/ECT@ECT, Dianne Seib/CAL/ECT@ECTEllis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Donna Consemiu/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Mills/HOU/ECT@ECT, RussSeverson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Martha Stevens/HOU/ECT@ECT, Karie Hastings/HOU/ECT@ECT,Regina Perkins/HOU/ECT@ECT, Imelda Frayre/HOU/ECT@ECT, William EKasemervisz/HOU/ECT@ECT, Hunaid Engineer/HOU/ECT@ECT, StevenGullion/HOU/ECT@ECT, Larrissa Sharma/HOU/ECT@ECT, Donna Greif/HOU/ECT@ECTRegarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA withIf someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created theability for you to invalidate the deal - and""Warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make surepipeline allows this change.""Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there isfeedback - I assume for the same reasonswe had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems(pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a newdeal and we will have to zero out the old deal.Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - justin case it causes problems with theirpipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to askthe UNIFY team.There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IMMarket East - but not fromENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must bethe same legal entity.""Warning - not the same legal entity""Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals(Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out).Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the itemswere locked down for a reason.If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked downdata that was validated - and someone used thesedeals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths createdusing these deals will get corrupted.

(Colo, Mia, OU, Neb, Mo, UT,UCLA)That Elusive Top 10Is this the year the Longhorns finally will finish in that elusive top 10nationally for the first time since 1983?The Longhorns are in the top 10 right now at No. 9 in the AP poll and theywill stay in that elite group and even rise a little if they keep winning.The biggest remaining obstacle to keeping winning is the game Saturdayagainst 5-1 Colorado.The Longhorns are 10-point favorites over the Buffaloes, but Colorado, at 5-1and with a five-game winning streak, is the most dangerous foe left on theschedule.Next up will be road trips to 2-3 Missouri ande 2-3 Baylor, teams which haveone Big 12 victory between them this season, followed by a game in Austinagainst Kansas, also 2-3.The Longhorns will be huge favorites in all three of those game.Then comes the regular season finale at Texas A&M. The Aggies lost toColorado, 31-21, Saturday in Boulder to fall from the unbeaten ranks, but thetoughest part of their schedule remains to be played.If  the Horns keep winning until the A&M game, they will be favored by atleast 10 points.The Aggies have a good defense, but it isn't as good as the one at Texas, andthe Horns have a clear edge on offense.So, barring an upset, the Longhorns should head for a bowl game at 10-1 andwith a national ranking in the top 5. A win in the bowl game would cement atop 5 ranking, but a loss might knock the Horns just out of the top 10 in thefinal poll.Longhorn Game Notes . .* After opening the game with a  12-play, 65-yard scoring drive, OklahomaState had six more possessions in the first half and gained 41 yards on 20plays. In the second half, OSU started drives at the Texas 36 and 21 afterturnovers, but came away with zero points. After its opening TD drive,Oklahoma State gained only  97 yards and had 163 for the game, its lowesttotal of the season.* QB Chris Simms was involved in all six  Texas touchdowns with a 1-yardrushing TD and scoring passes of 27 yards to Brock Edwards, 5 and 16 yards toRoy Williams and  27 and  23 yards to Sloan Thomas. He fell one short of theUT record of seven set by Clyde Littlefield against Daniel Baker (4 pass/3rush) in 1915. The last Longhorn to account for six touchdowns in a game wasRicky Williams against Rice in 1998.* Freshman LB Derrick Johnson had two tackles for losses in the first half tomove into a tie for third place on UT's all-time freshman list. He has 10TFLs for the season, just six short of the Longhorns record held by TonyBrackens who had 16 in 1993.* Sophomore WR Sloan Thomas had six catches for 82 yards Saturday. Both werecareer bests. His  previous highs were three catches against Missouri in 2000and 74 yards against Texas A&M in 2000. He tied his career high with two TDpasses, last accomplishing the feat against Missouri.UT No. 22 in Basketball PollThe Longhorn men's basketball team has been ranked No. 22 in the ESPN.compre-season top 25.Texas is one of five Big 12 Conference teams selected in the Top 25, joiningKansas (5), Missouri (8), Oklahoma State (16) and Oklahoma (19).The Longhorns return 57 percent of their scoring, 69 percent of theirrebounding and 63 percent of their minutes played totals from last year's25-9 team which finished with a No. 18 national ranking in the AP poll.Texas starts its exhibition schedule with the annual intrasquad scrimmage at7 p.m. on Wednesday, October 31 at the Erwin Center.

This does notonly mean those large facilities in nonattainment areas, but ANY facilitythat was constructed prior to September, 1971 and has not subsequently beenrolled into some sort of new source review (NSR) permit or Permit by Rule(formerly Standard Exemption).  Note that proposed new rules recentlypublished in the Texas Register for public comment will require operators tobe able to produce documentation of applicability and compliance for allfacilities authorized by a Permit by Rule/Standard Exemption, much the sameas is required for any other type of permit.The TNRCC Sunset Bill contains language limiting the time that suchfacilities may operate without NSR authorization of some sort.  The SenateCommittee Substitute (SCS) for HB 2912 is a little stricter than the versionpassed by the House, but both versions did contain grandfathered facilitypermitting provisions and it is safe to assume that the final version willalso.  If this version passes, you will have one additional year to applyfor a Voluntary Emissions Reduction Permit (VERP).  If your facility is apipeline facility, the TNRCC will require no more than a 30% reduction inNOx, and that reduction can be averaged for several facilities in the samearea covered in one permit.Note that it is only through the efforts of our lobbyists - particularlyCindy Morphew of TxOGA and Celina Romero of ATINGP - that it looks as thoughwe will get an additional opportunity to get these facilities permittedwithout having to use today's BACT.This memo summarizes the SCS provisions for your information.  This is NOTactual bill language - I've TRIED to make it easier to read.Note that these provisions may be changed somewhat if the House does notconcur in all of the changes made by the Senate and the bill goes toConference.  In addition, we expect a strong attempt to amend the bill onthe Senate floor to require shutdown on September 1, 2001 of grandfatheredfacilities that do not have a pending permit application.  If that attemptis successful, the opportunity to apply for a VERP will be gone on September1.The memo also recaps previous recommendations to you regarding the currentopportunity to claim historical Permits by Rule (Standard Exemptions) as ameans of permitting a grandfathered facility.  I am not certain how longthis opportunity will continue to exist.  TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WHILE YOUCAN.In addition, I've appended some information on 10-year old BACT forgas-fired IC engines and turbines that might be useful if you are trying toget a VERP now.PROVISIONS OF SCS FOR HB 2912 (PRIOR TO SENATE FLOOR DEBATE)Sec. 382.05181.  PERMIT REQUIRED.(a)  Any grandfathered facility that does not have an application pendingfor a new source review permit or other authorization, other than a federaloperating permit, and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown as(1)  September 1, 2003, if the facility is located in anonattainment area; or(2)  September 1, 2005, if the facility is located in an attainmentarea.(b)  Any grandfathered facility that does not have a permit or otherauthorization under this chapter, other than a federal operating permit(1)  September 1, 2005, if the facility is located in anonattainment area; or(2)  September 1, 2007, if the facility is located in an attainmentarea.(c)  Facilities eligible for a Small Business Stationary Source Permit aresubject to the permitting deadlines in Section 382.05184.Sec. 382.05182.  NOTICE OF SHUTDOWN.(a)  A notice of shutdown to allow operation of a grandfathered facilitybeyond the deadlines of 382.05181(a) must be filed with the commissionbefore the applicable deadline.(1)  the date the facility intends to cease operating;(2)  an inventory of the type and amount of emissions thatwill be eliminated when the facility ceases to operate; and(3)  any other necessary and relevant information thecommission by rule deems appropriate.GENERAL PROVISIONS (APPLICABLE TO PERMITS UNDER 382.05183, 382.05184, AND382.05186)(a)  The commission shall grant a permit under this section if, from theinformation available to the commission, including information presented atany public hearing or through written comment, the commission finds thatthere is no indication that the emissions from the facility will contravenethe intent of this chapter, including protection of the public's health andphysical property.(b)  If the commission finds that the emissions from the facility will notcomply with Subsection (c), the commission may not grant the permit underthis section.(c)  A person planning the modification of a facility previously permittedunder this section must comply with new source permitting requirementsbefore modifying.(d)  The commission may adopt rules as necessary to implement and administerthis section.(e)  If an applicant omits any relevant facts or submits incorrectinformation in an application, the applicant shall submit the relevant factsor correct the information no later than 60 days after discovering theerror.  If while processing the application, the commission determines thatadditional information is necessary to evaluate or to take final action onthe application, the commission may request the information and set areasonable deadline for a response.  Failure to comply with the deadline forthe response will result in the application being returned to the applicant.Sec. 382.05183.  EXISTING FACILITY PERMIT.(a)  The owner or operator of a grandfathered facility may apply for apermit to operate the facility under this section.(b)  The commission shall grant a permit under this section if, from theinformation available to the commission, including information presented atany public hearing or through written comment, the commission finds that the(1)  is filed before September 1, 2002 and the facility willuse an air pollution control method at least as effective as 10-year oldBACT; or(2)  is filed before the applicable deadline of 382.05181(a)and the facility will use current BACT.(c)  The commission may issue an existing facility flexible permit for someor all of the grandfathered facilities at a site.  Permits issued under thissubsection shall follow the same permit issuance, modification, and renewalprocedures as existing facility permits.Sec. 382.05184.  SMALL BUSINESS STATIONARY SOURCE PERMIT.(a)  Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small businessstationary source and are not required by commission rule to submit anannual emissions inventory report may apply for a permit under this sectionbefore September 1, 2005.(b)  Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small businessstationary source that does not have an application pending for a new sourcereview permit or other authorization, other than a federal operating permit,and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown, may not emit aircontaminants on or after September 1, 2007.Sec.  382.05185.  ELECTRIC GENERATING FACILITY PERMIT.Special provisions for permitting grandfathered electric generatingfacilities are not outlined in this memo.Sec. 382.05186.  AUTHORIZATION FOR PIPELINE FACILITIES.(a)  The commission by rule shall establish the procedures for applicationsfor grandfathered processing, treating, compression, or pumping facilitiesconnected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline.(b)  Based on a prioritization by the commission as necessary to meet local,regional, and statewide air quality needs related directly or indirectly tofederal air quality standards, the commission may require up to a 30%reduction of the hourly emission rates of NOx and VOC from reciprocatinginternal combustion engines subject to this section.  For facilities otherthan reciprocating internal combustion engines that are connected to or partof a gathering or transmission pipeline , the commission may considerrequiring hourly emissions rate reductions of up to 30% for NOx and 20% forVOC.  The commission by rule may designate counties or regions of the statewhere greater reductions in the hourly emission rate will be required thanin other areas, but no more than 30 percent reductions in the hourly ratemay be required in any area.(1)  allow for a single permit for all facilities connectedto or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline;(2)  allow for required reductions for facilities under thissection to be achieved at one facility or averaged among more than onefacility and located in the same local, regional, or statewide areasdesignated by the commission under Subsection (b);(3)  for purposes of emission averaging, allow emissionreductions achieved from grandfathered since September 1, 1997; and(4)  allow an owner or operator to apply for separatepermits under this section for discrete and separate facilities connected toor part of a gathering or transmission pipeline.(d)  Facilities authorized by this section shall be considered permittedunder this chapter.CURRENT OPPORTUNITY TO CLAIM A PERMIT BY RULE TO ""PERMIT"" A GRANDFATHEREDFACILITYTNRCC has interpreted its rules to allow operators to permit grandfatheredfacilities using any applicable ""Permit by Rule,"" including those previouslyreferred to as Standard Exemptions.For instance, old Standard Exemption 7, effective May 8, 1972, was for ""Gasfired internal combustion engines of less than 2000 hp and engine trains ofless than 5000 hp total"" and can be used to permit any such engine(s).  Forclarification on this particular exemption, the language used by staff inproposing this exemption to the Texas Air Control Board in 1972 was asconsidered a substantial source unless joined together IN SERIES (emphasisadded) to form an engine train.  Engine trains of less than 5000 hp are notconsidered a substantial source.  Because control technology for NOxemissions from internal combustion and gas fired engines is very limited, itis doubtful if significant control could be achieved through the permitsystem at this time.""  (""Exemptions From Permits Procedures andJustification for Exemptions,"" <signed> Charles R. Barden, P.E., ExecutiveSecretary, Texas Air Control Board, May 8, 1972.)A list of the ""Historical Standard Exemptions"" is available on the TNRCCapplying these ""Permits by Rule,"" be sure to check the corresponding""Exemption Preambles"" (if any) for any applicable General Conditions.TNRCC has asked that we document such permitting of grandfathered facilitiesby PI-8 AND a simple notification cover letter to them so that they willhave a record that the facilities have been permitted and are no longerconsidered to be grandfathered.  The registration will buy you a letter ofacknowledgement that you have claimed the ""permit by rule"" (don't use theterm ""exemption"" in any correspondence) for these engines.CORRESPONDENCE WITH TNRCC ON 10-YEAR OLD BACT FOR GAS ENGINES AND TURBINESmphilli@enron.com; williamkendrick@enron.com; clowneys@epenergy.com;jordand@epenergy.com; tom.palmer@gt.pge.com; BagleyW@kochind.com;Howard0W@kochind.com; NickelD@kochind.com;scott.wallace@mitchell-energy.com; greg_hardin@oxy.com; deesaw@texaco.com;cmorphew@txoga.orgI believe that we have now gotten the last bit of information that the TRNCCwill provide to us regarding the development of guidelines for 10-year BACTfor grandfathered engines and turbines for use in the VERP program.  Thelast piece of information is an email that I am forwarding to you with thisemail.  It is an email from John Steib to which he attaches an email fromJim Linville.  In response to a request from us, Jim Linville sets forth inhis email an example of a large engine with emissions in the 29 gram perhorsepower hour range that cannot reduce emissions to the 2-8 gram level andwhat the owner/operator of that engine must demonstrate in order to obtain aVERP permit.Remember, that in order to be included in the TNRCC's January 15, 2001report to the legislature, a letter of intent or application for a VERPshould be filed with the TNRCC on or before next Thursday, December 7, 2000.1. Grandfathered internal combustion engines of less than 2000horsepower can be authorized by Standard Exemption No. 6 effective December1, 1972, regardless of the level of emissions from those facilities. (See myletter to Kerry Drake dated September 15, 2000 and Drake's letter to medated October 3, 2000).2. Grandfathered engine trains of less than 5000 horsepower, or aportion of an engine train up to 5000 horsepower may be authorized underStandard Exemption No. 6, December 1, 1972, so long as each engine in thetrain does not exceed 2000 horsepower.  (See my letter to James Randalldated November 1, 2000 and Randall's letter to me dated November 16, 2000).3. Grandfathered turbines of less than 20,000 horsepower may beauthorized by Standard Exemption No. 82, dated December 1, 1972 regardlessof the level of emissions.  (See my letter to Kerry Drake dated September15, 2000 and Drake's letter to me dated October 3, 2000).4. Grandfathered engines and turbines that are able to be controlled tothe 2-8 gram range will not be subject to an economic reasonableness review.(See James Randall's letter to me dated November 16, 2000).5. Grandfathered engines and turbines that are not able to becontrolled to the 2-8 gram range may be permittable under a VERP if there istest data to validate the old (pre-modification) and new (post-modification)emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissionswould be achieved.  Also needed would be a representation of the cost of thecontrols and even though additional modifications are available, theadditional cost is prohibitive. (See Jim Randall's letter to me datedNovember 16, 2000 and the email attached hereto).I hope all of this is helpful.  I have forwarded to you copies of thereferenced letters by fax on earlier dates.  If you need another copy pleaselet me know.Celina.Celina and James,During our teleconference today, you asked for an example of what we wouldconsider ""significant emission reductions"" that would be acceptable in acase-by-case review when the 2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx level could not be achieved.A large 2-stroke engine that is currently emitting approximately 29 g/hp-hrof NOx would be considered to have significant emissions reductions ifactual emissions are reduced by 50 percent even though it does not meet the2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx level.  We would agree that this would have beenconsidered BACT 10 years ago if there was test data to validate the old(pre-modification) and new (post-modification) emission rates to documentthat verifiable reductions in actual emissions would be achieved.  Alsoneeded in the case-by-case review would be a representation of what the costof the controls would be with a discussion of why the  2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOxlevel could not be achieved.  This may be due to technical limitations suchas no additional controls or modifications are possible, or you may identifycost in dollars per ton of NOx controlled to show that even thoughadditional modifications are available, the cost is prohibitive..williamkendrick@enron.com; jordand@epenergy.com; tom.palmer@gt.pge.com;BagleyW@kochind.com; Howard0W@kochind.com; NickelD@kochind.com;scott.wallace@mitchell-energy.com; greg_hardin@oxy.com; deesaw@texaco.com;cmorphew@txoga.orgI received by fax late yesterday evening, a letter signed by John Steib re10-yr BACT guidelines for engines and turbines for use in the VERP program.After my first read, it looks pretty good.  Look for a copy of it by fax.Let me know if you have any comments or concerns that we need to clear upwith the TNRCC.CelinaNovember 16, 2000Ms. Celina RomeroAttorneyClark, Thomas & WintersP.O. Box 1148Austin, Texas  78767Engines and TurbinesAs discussed in our meetings and teleconferences concerning the options forgrandfathered internal combustion engines and turbines, we have agreed thatsome of these facilities may qualify under Standard Exemption Nos. 6 or 82,effective on December 1, 1972 and others may be permitted under 30 TexasReduction Permits (VERP).  Specific questions raised are discussed below.You have asked for our understanding of what qualifies as an ""engine trainof less than 5,000 hp."" In your November 1, 2000 letter you gave twoexamples of ""engine trains"" that you felt would meet Standard Exemption No.6, ""Gas fired internal combustion engines of less than 2000 hp and enginetrains of less than 5,000 hp total.""  We agree that several engines, eachless than 2000 hp, can be combined into a ""train"" providing compression to acommon header so long as the train does not exceed 5,000 hp, meet theexemption requirements.  In cases where the total horsepower in a trainexceeds 5,000 hp, we will allow exemption of individual engines within sucha train provided that each engine is less than 2000 hp and the totalhorsepower of exempted engines in the train does not exceed 5,000 hp.  Inthe same standard exemption list, turbines were covered by StandardExemption No. 82, ""Gas turbines of less than 20,000 hp burning sweet naturalgas.""The other major point of discussion has been the determination of ""10 yearold BACT"" required by 30 TAC o116.811(3)(A).  As we discussed, our review ofpermitting 10 years ago reveals that very few, if any, old engines werepermitted; so no data is available to show what we would have required fornitrogen oxides (NOX) best available control technology (BACT).  New engineswere permitted at 2 grams/horsepower-hour (g/hp-hr) of NOX for both richburn and lean burn engines.  At that time older rich burn engines could havebeen readily upgraded with catalytic converters to meet this 2 g/hp-hr limitfor NOX.  Lean burn engines were and are still more problematic as both2-stroke and 4-stroke versions are available, and no single method ofcontrol is applicable.  The large number of different engine manufacturers,and the availability of various models, makes it impossible to establish asingle 10 year old BACT level.  Some of the older engines may be capable ofbeing upgraded to meet a level of NOX of 5 to 8 g/hp-hr, the levelestablished in the 1992 revision of Standard Exemption No. 6, which alsoestablished a 3 g/hp-hr standard for turbines.  While the standard exemptiondoes not establish BACT for upgrades it does recognize what is available.Many of the grandfathered engines are large and some have emissions as highas 25 to 29 g/hp-hr, so significant emission reductions may be achievableeven if they are not able to reduce to the emissions control level of 2 to 8g/hp-hr.  The 10 year old BACT review on these engines and turbines willhave to be done on a case-by-case basis just as we would have done 10 yearsago.We hope this guidance will allow your members to decide which engines theywill be able to either exempt or permit under the VERP program and submittheir letters of intent to participate in the VERP program by December 7,2000.For engines and turbines that your members decide to propose forauthorization under Standard Exemption Nos. 6 and 82, please identify thespecific engines and turbines, identified by unit number, emission pointnumber (EPN), air quality account number, and plant name; and for eachaccount please submit a Form PI-7.  For each engine or turbine, pleasesubmit a, Table 29 or 31 as applicable, and other technical information thatwill support the standard exemption claim.For engines that will be authorized by a VERP permit, please identify eachengine by unit number, EPN, air quality account number, and plant name, andprovide an estimate of the amount of emissions reductions anticipated as aresult of participation in the VERP program.  When the VERP applications aresubmitted, information should be provided to show that NOX emissions will bein the 2 to 8 g/hp-hr range.  If it is not possible to achieve this level ofemissions, please submit information that shows that it is not technicallyfeasible or economically reasonable to control NOX emissions to that level.Information showing that actual emissions reductions will be achieved, evenwhen the targeted range of 2 to 8 g/hp-hr cannot be met, will be helpful instaff review of the application.We appreciate your assistance in helping us to make the VERP program asuccess.

"Hey Guys.The ISO cutting our off-peak imports from PV has been an ongoing problem. Now that we are doing congestion wheels again we can finally do something to avoid these cuts using congestion wheels.Normally the ISO will cut our Import and shift our load from NP15 (PGE1&2&3) across the path to relieve the congestion. If you submit a congestion wheel there cannot be $30 cong,  thus they will not cut your schedule going in at PV.  Instead of shifting your load the ISO will award your congestion wheel and everybody will be happy. It is important to make your wheel larger then your import to ensure that part of your import not getting cut. I would recommend to put in the max number of MW's you think you can buy in the North and get rid of in the Desert.

Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.Sincerely,Robert Briden",klay@enron.com,rbriden@ballou.com,Demand Ken Lay Donate Proceeds from Enron Stock Sales,False
"I was informed late last week that EOL is looking to me to determine whetherU.S. counterparties should be permitted to trade European power products viaEOL.  According to Edmund Cooper and Tana Jones, the London office isdeciding whether European counterparties should be permitted to trade U.S.power products via EOL.  I believe that this allocation of counterpartyreview responsibility (with regard to power products) should be reversed.The legal team for U.S. power is in the best position to determine whether acounterparty, domestic or European, has the requisite legal authority totrade U.S. power, and I believe that the London office is better positionedto determine whether a counterparty, U.S. or other, has the requisiteauthority to trade a European power product.As we have discussed during the last week, a counterparty must have specificfederal regulatory authorization in order to trade U.S. power.  I cannotidentify any foreign counterparties from my lists of federally authorizedentities and think it highly unlikely that a foreign counterparty will havethe necessary authority to trade U.S. power.  Jim Fallon has expresslyinstructed me that in the event we do not currently trade U.S. power with acounterparty and cannot otherwise confirm that a specific counterpartypossesses regulatory approval to trade power, a counterparty should NOT bepermitted to trade U.S. power via EOL.  Accordingly, I return to my initialposition that except for those foreign counterparties with whom we arecurrently trading over-the-counter (if any), all foreign counterpartiesshould be granted read-only access to U.S. power products.  In the event aspecific counterparty requests access to U.S. power trading, we can examinewhether that specific party possesses the necessary authority to tradepower.Edmund Cooper and Justin Boyd are reviewing whether a similar bar shouldapply to the trading of European power by U.S. counterparties, and I willdefer to their judgment on that issue.Please call me at *36121 with any questions or comments.Regards,Leslie Hansen","frank.davis@enron.com, david.forster@enron.com, bob.shults@enron.com",leslie.hansen@enron.com,Trading of U.S. Power Products by European Counterparties,False

TheSCE realizes that maintaining the AB1890 Rate Freeze will most likely nothelp them recover their remaining CTCs and may in fact result in reducing thelevel of CTC revenues recovered thus far.  Under the AB1890 Rate Freeze,SCE's shareholders now incur the risks associated with the commodity marketprices.SCE also realizes that the CPUC, State of California, and public will notallow SCE to artificially end the rate freeze early and forego recovery ofcorporations to elect to take a loss on collection of utilitygeneration-related assets and obligations in order to terminate the ratefreeze that is currently providing protection from the current high andvolatile electricity prices.""Realizing that no one will allow customers to see high and volatileelectricity prices, SCE has proposed and supports this Rate StabilizationProposal, so that it  can exercise the option to artificially end the ratefreeze early.This type of option to PG&E and SCE could result in a financial loss to EnronEnergy Services if the Rate Stabilization proposal does not equal apply to DAcustomers, as well as SO customers.It is clear that the proposal is to require the CPUC to stablize rates afterthe AB1890 Rate Freeze.  It is not clear whether the proposal is a ratefreeze or cap, that is left up to the CPUC.  Most of the implementationdetails are left to the CPUC, provided that the CPUC implemented anon-bypassable rate to customers who benefit and the stabilized rates remainin effect through March 31, 2003.It  is not clear whether the Post Freeze Rate Stabilization proposal applieschosen to purchase electricity through direct transactins may also beexperiencing large increases in electricity costs.""It is clear the SCE wants to move to a new paradigm from the AB1890 RateFreeze where SCE's shareholders incur the risks of high and volatile comodityprices to this Rate Stabilization Proposal (Rate Freeze or Cap) whereratepayers incur such risks.  (This clearly demonstrates why utilities arethe wrong company for the job).Despite our philosophical beliefs or future value propositions, if the RateStabilization Proposal allows utilities to end the rate freeze early and doesnot equally apply to DA customers, depending on when utilities will elect toend the AB1890 Rate Freeze, we may be talking about a $100 million hit orswing to our book.Needless to say, we need to support parity between DA and SO under the RateStabilization Proposal.Roger","dennis.benevides@enron.com, bruno.gaillard@enron.com,",roger.yang@enron.com,SCE's Rate Stabilization Legislative Proposal,False

They are fine with the Enron threshold beingat US $100 million.Regarding the CSA, since Great Lakes Power is giving a $12 million parentalguarantee, the collateral threshold amount for Maclaren should be $12million.  Your e-mail below states that Enron' parent will be giving a $30million parental guarantee.  My understanding is that this guarantee was tobe $15 million.  Regardless, I believe that Maclaren is only willing toaccept $15 million of credit risk from both Enron entities.

"responses to Broadwing's defenses and counterargumentsrichard.sanders@enron.com, wilson.dietrich@enron.com,kevin.kohnstamm@enron.comrichard.sanders@enron.com, wilson.dietrich@enron.com,kevin.kohnstamm@enron.comHere are my preliminary thoughts about Broadwing's likely responses to ourclaims, and how we might respond to them.  I'd like to discuss these withyou, Dave, sometime this week, as well as your thoughts about the likelycourse of the arguments.  I'd also invite Brad and Ron to add to or modify mystatements, below, if they are not accurate.  Dave and Steve, now that we'rein this thing, I want to hit as hard as we can, taking full advantage of theshock value of these truly awful facts, and do everything reasonably possibleto obtain a preliminary injunction stopping Broadwing's construction, or atthe very least ordering them to stop construction (in Wyoming, and, ifpossible, in Colorado) until they have executed and complied with aconstruction coordination agreement.line.Broadwing's contractor continued ripping us up when they should have stopped;it is their obligation to protect our system, no matter what we do.2.  EBS' line wasn't properly marked.  The line weaves left and right, andwas marked as if it were laid in a straight line.company that laid EBS' line only a few months earlier, and therefore knew thelocation of EBS' line.  Also, Broadwing knows that the sloping and rockyterrain causes the plow to wander somewhat, and Broadwing knew, especiallyafter the first few cuts, that it was too close to EBS' line.discussed a claim against them, earlier, but I didn't think about whetherthey should have been named as a defendant.  What do you think?  It doesn'trelate to the injunction, does it, but it does relate to the damage action.]3.  EBS didn't have enough inspectors out to protect its system.every plow at every minute.  In some cases where our inspector told theBroadwing contractor to stop work because the EBS cable was in danger ofimminent harm, Broadwing did not stop, and the cable was cut.  So it isn'tclear that more inspectors would have helped, since Broadwing ignored themanyway.4.   Some cuts must be expected, when a cable is being laid close to anexisting cable.above the usual number that would be anticipated.  Clearly Broadwing has beennegligent in its disregard for EBS' existing facility.  All Broadwing wantsto do is the push through quickly.  Its contractors clearly behave in anegligent manner.  For example, when we hired Mears Construction in Texas,and they cut another company's cable, they stopped, and immediately examinedthe damage, contacted the cable's owner, and offered to repair the damage.When Mears was working for Broadwing in Wyoming, however, and Mears cut theEBS cable, Mears didn't contact EBS and kept on working, and even kept ondamaging additional EBS facilities.5.  EBS' damages are only its actual cost to repair the cuts.cases replace entire segments of cable (because too many splice repairsresults in too much communications signal loss), which is very expensive($275,000 per reel of cable).  Also, EBS is close to lighting its system(i.e., carrying traffic); when that happens, EBS' damages will bereputation, etc.6.  Uinta County is the true culprit, since it forced us to be only 3' awayfrom EBS' cable.the problem.  That requirement is bad engineering practice, but results fromthe county's over-arching desire to maximize right of way revenue at allcosts, without regard to actual construction realities.  Unfortunately, thecounty is immune.  Broadwing, however, is still responsible for protectingexisting facilities, and is clearly responsible for all damages that result.There are numerous construction measures that Broadwing could and should havehave dug periodic ""potholes"" to find out exactly where the line was, in orderto avoid it.  It could have dug trenches to lay the cable, wherever it wastoo close for plowing.  In every case, Broadwing merely did what was easistand cheapest, without regard to EBS' line's security.  This is not acceptableconstruction practice; it is instead the practice of a fly-by-night operationthat does not demonstrate basic regard for others' property.7.   Broadwing is committed to avoiding any damage to EBS' facilities.statements to EBS personnel which indicate that this is true, Broadwing'sstatements to EBS have repeatedly been proved to be either knowingly falsestatements or based on misunderstood inaccurate reports from its own fieldpersonnel.  Broadwing refused to sign, or even to negotiate, a ""constructioncoordination agreement"" which EBS supplied to Broadwing, which is designed topromote communication and cooperation, and prevent further damage.  (EBSsigned such an agreement with AT&T, after EBS' contractor cut AT&T's cable.)EBS has exhausted all its options with Broadwing, and must have relief fromthe court.  The timing of this hearing is critical, as EBS is about to lightup its system, and cannot do so until the new cable is installed (to replaceall the cut cable), and will suffer much greater damages once EBS traffic isinterrupted.--Kenton","dditto@hollandhart.com, sblack@hollandhart.com",kenton.erwin@enron.com,our,True

"As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.

As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.

"M=20---------------------------Alan Comnesgreg.wolfe@enron.com, steve hall@enron=20The following are  some  notes and questions regarding FERC's December 15==20Order intended to supplement Mary's notes distributed over the weekend.1. Penalty on Underscheduled Load=20a. Penalty thresholdThe FERC stood by its Nov 1 recommendation to impose a penalty on all SC's==20that underschedule by more than 5%.  The only change relative to November 1==20is that the FERC will allow SC's with loads 200 MW or less to have up to 10==20MW imbalance without penalty.  EPMI as a power marketer, has a highly=20variable load, I assume.  Do we need to seek clarification from FERC or ISO==20on how ISO will measure the load (annual average, annual peak, monthly peak=?)=20used to determine whether the applicable penalty threshold  is 10 MW or 5%?==20Guidance from traders would be appreciated.b. Estimated billsFERC allows the ISO to implement a blended ""automated/manual"" process to=20implement the ISO's load imbalance penalty.  To simplify the settlement=20process, the ISO is allowed to institute estimated billing procedures on a==20temporary basis.  Does EPMI have a serious problem with being billed on an==20estimated basis?2. Documenting Incremental Seller Costs, Including Opportunity CostsThe FERC order raises important issues with regard to documenting our costs=,=20which will be required on all sales to the ISO or PX effective on 1/1/01.  =In=20=20the unworkable complexities that the opportunity cost concept introduces in==20the ISO real-time imbalance market, we will eliminate it.""  Enron will=20undoubtedly raise the impermissibility of opportunity costs in its rehearin=g=20request.  Among other things, EPMI will  argue that opportunity costs are a==20legitimate economic cost, that such costs are used in transmission pricing,==20and that without such costs the FERC is essentially taking=20generator/marketers back to cost-of-service ratemakingThis being said, EPMI must operate without the benefit of using opportunity==20costs as a basis for documenting above-$150/MWh accepted bids effective=201/1/01.As noted in the list of information that must be reported by Enron (see=20Mary's summary or p. 59 of the FERC order), sellers that have not generated==20their own power can report ""purchase price"".  Is West Trading prepared to==20document every above-$150/MWh sale to the ISO or PX with an associated=20""purchase price?""  In addition, other costs that clearly apply to a=20marketer--such as transmission access costs, transmission losses, expected==20replacement power costs, start-up/no-load costs--are not allowed on the=20list.  (We should not the omission of these costs in our petition for=20rehearing.)In several places in the order, the Commission states that sellers should b=e=20allowed to earn reasonable profits but little guidance is given.  The only==20concrete guidance I found was in Massey's concurring opinion which identifi=ed=20$25/MWh as a ""reasonable capacity adder.""Accepted bids below $150/MWh do not require documentation.

Most keysectors should benefit from these reforms, which will thus give a new boostto the country's economic and social progress. As such, the budget waswelcomed with great enthusiasm by the Indian and international businesscommunity.On the occasion of our India Economic Summit 2001 to be held in partnershipwith the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) from 2 to 4 December in NewDelhi, it will be the perfect time to assess the progress of the bold andextensive measures proposed in the recent budget, how they have beenimplemented and how they have impacted the business environment, domesticindustry activity and foreign investment.As we will soon be preparing the preliminary programme of the Summit, Iwould like to take the opportunity to benefit from your expertise andunderstanding of the country. I would greatly appreciate receiving from youany particular topics or issues that you wish to see given priority on theagenda. Any suggestions of relevant speakers or experts that you may havewould also be welcomed.I look forward to receiving your response at the above e-mail address andmitra.khoubrou@weforum.org).For more information on the 2001-2002 Union Budget, please visit theI look forward to hearing from you and hope that you will be with us inIndia again next December.Best regards,Colette Mathur,Director,Center for Regional StrategiesWorld Economic Forum","""klay@enron.com"" <klay@enron.com>",rosalee.fleming@enron.com,"India Economic Summit 2001, New Delhi 2-4 December",False

We are drafting a ""pitch letter"" to send out by the end of this weekreporters; 2) mainstream media reporters working the energy crisis; and 3)trade media.  We may also outreach to our editorial board list as well.  Ourpitch will be focused on what it will really mean for small business and C&Icustomers to lose the option of retail choice at a time when they aresuffering the financial hardships of skyrocketing energy bills. We willaddress the effect on California's future business climate if direct accessis not preserved through legislation that corrects the problems that AB1xcaused for retail choice.  And finally, we will address the point that nomatter what direction California ultimately takes, direct access must be apart of the solution.  Reporters have seen the recent polls which illustrateCalifornia businesses' concerns with the path the state is on so this is aprime opportunity to build on those recent media stories.2.    We recommend a conference call with AReM and the Direct AccessCoalition on Friday to address the questions and suggestions on the pressstrategy outlined here.3.     Determine which people in the Direct Access Coalition are willing totake media calls on behalf of the coalition.Next Week1.   Follow up with key reporters who received the pitch letter.2.

"print---------------------- Forwarded by Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT on 10/02/2000Rick Bergsieker@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTBobby retires this month, but will continue as a consultant to Enron India.His stated intention is to shadow Clay and his team to help arrange LNGsupplies for Metgas.  We do not need this and it adds a layer of confusionwhenever he is in attendance in negotiations, but to date neither Wade norSanjay has been willing or able to control this.  The India group tends toblame their failure to market Metgas supplies on the LNG team's ""failure"" toget better terms, and they insist that Bobby or others attend the meetings toensure that we are doing a good job.We believe that we have obtained LNG for Metgas on favorable terms,particularly in light of the fact that we have convinced Malaysia and AbuDhabi to accept the credit risk of Metgas customers, i.e., with no Ennronsupport in the middle and no Indian government support behind the buyers).They believe that our supplies are priced 50 cents above the ""market"", whichthey perceive to be Qatari supplies to Petronet ( a proposedgovernment-backed LNG import project in Western India that is a long way frombeing real).We believe that we know the pricing terms for the proposed Petronet deal andthat the price is not as low as rumored.  We also believe that the Metgascustomers are willing to pay the price that we have negotiated and that theMetgas pipeline economics are sound (although the India group has beenunwilling to share their economics with us) and that, once the LNG contractsare in place, we can reduce the LNG price significantly via a backhaul fromMalaysia using ADGAS/TEPCO ships.   We can further reduce the price if we canget access to the spare capacity on the ship dedicated to DPC and use it tomove incremental cargoes from Abu Dhabi to Metgas.Bobby and his team want us to reopen the price in the Mayasia term sheet.  Wedo not intend to do this.  Malaysia has told us that they will walk the dealif we insist on a lower price.  Malaysia recently sold additional volumes toJapan for a price about 20 cents higher than the price to Metgas and theybelieve they can also sell our volumes at a higher price to more creditworthybuyers in the far east.The Malaysia COI includes a cp that Metgas will finalize contracts with itsend buyers by Sep 1999.  We have repeatedly  gotten Malaysia to extend thistarget date, which is now end October 2000, but Malaysia is getting impatientwith India and I am not sure how much longer we can hold this togetherwithout some more firm evidence from India that the markets are realI will be in India on Oct 4/5 to meet with Sanjay and Wade to discuss this.We will also try to finalize the terms for us to provide LNG  fuel managementand shipping services to both DPC and Metgas, and will seek clarificationfrom Wade/Sanjay as to how they intend to sell down DPC/Metgas without losingcontrol of the LNG terminal.  Clay, V V RAo and Wayne Perry will be with me.Working with India is never easyRickI'm hearing a little noise about Bobby Ferris in Sanjay's group.  Did heretire or not?

I have asked Kay if she still has a concern withthe Limit of Liability as it relates to termination.  I think it works.d.  I ""volunteered"" to work over Article 10, Exhibit B-3 and Exhibit B-6 inrelation to Guarantees and liquidated damages.  I have done that in theattached redline of the T&C and Exhibits.e. Some time ago I volunteered to resurrect the language associated with thereduction in the LD refund in Section 10.9.8.   I had sent out a couple weeksago but received no reaction.    I have entered that fix in the attachedredline.f.  I have made several minor changes to definitions associated withperformance.Attached is Rev4-JR version of GE T&C's and Exhibits for world hunger.  Theystart from the clean rev 4 version of the T&Cs that Peter forwarded to me atmy request.

"FYI.  See highlighted comments below.  Don't know if you've heard, but there's considerable talk about Davis trying to get the bonds out via Executive Order.  How that might work technically is unclear---at the end of the day, Lynch & Co. have to approve any ratepayer funds used to service the bonds.  Perhaps Davis is thinking about shifting the burden to taxpayers generally.  In off line conversations with JP Morgan people, they're saying the Executive Order route is ""doable,"" but they ain't giving any details.  We're trying to find out more.Alternative SDG&E debt plan to get hearingsApproval of the governor's plan for paying the $747 million debt SDG&E says it is owed by its customers appeared less certain yesterday, as the president of the state utilities commission said she planned to hold public hearings for an alternative proposal.Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said in a local radio interview that regulators will hold hearings in San Diego regarding a plan from consumer groups that purports to save customers about $185 million more than the governor's proposal.The groups said the earlier plan negotiated between the governor and the utility would be costly for consumers and a windfall for San Diego Gas & Electric.At stake is how much SDG&E contributes and how much customers pay toward the debt, which accumulated in a so-called balancing account when SDG&E paid more for electricity than it was able to collect from customers during the power crisis.Despite the plan for hearings, Lynch told KPBS-FM radio that the commission would make a final decision about how to resolve the controversial $747 million debt by November.The governor and SDG&E announced their plan in June, saying it required the utility to contribute $319 million toward the debt and eliminated the balancing account without lengthy litigation or raising rates.Consumer groups, led by the San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, say the governor's plan does not go far enough, particularly because SDG&E earned an estimated $400 million in profits from the sale of electricity during the power crisis.Under the governor's plan, those profits are awarded to the company's shareholders, though SDG&E would use $219 million from the profits as part of its $319 million contribution toward the debt.Under the consumer groups' plan, SDG&E would be allowed to keep some of the profits, but it would contribute $72 million more than it would under the governor's plan. The alternative plan also would require the utility to make other monetary concessions.In a formal decision earlier this year, the California utilities commission said SDG&E's profits do belong to customers. SDG&E has sued to overturn the decision in court, but it has put the litigation on hold pending the utilities commission's resolution of the plan to pay the debt.Michael Shames, executive director of UCAN, said yesterday that he was encouraged by Lynch's call for hearings on the consumer plan.""There is $400 million at stake here,"" Shames said.SDG&E said yesterday that it had not received formal notification about the hearings, nor had it yet seen the alternative plan for paying the debt.A spokesman for the utility, however, repeated earlier comments that the company saw the alternative plan as an attempt to derail the PUC's process of considering the governor's plan.Lynch also said yesterday that the utilities commission would continue to challenge the more than $40 billion in long-term electricity contracts signed by the state during the crisis.Lynch said the agreements bind the state to overpriced power and are in violation of federal law requiring electricity rates to be ""just and reasonable.""The utilities commission president said the contracts may be even more expensive than earlier thought because at least some of the power they bind California to purchase is not needed. The extra costs would damage businesses and family budgets, she said.""If you have to pay three to four times more for energy, you don't have the money to grow your business or meet other needs of your family,"" Lynch said.She also defended action by the commission last week that effectively delayed the sale of $12.5 billion in state bonds needed to pay power costs. Lynch said the commission supported a legislative proposal for floating the bonds, which would separate them from the long-term power contracts.","f..calger@enron.com, tim.belden@enron.com",jeff.dasovich@enron.com,Lynch continues to take shots at DWR's LT contracts,False

Wait any longer, and you'll miss thebest shot at a ten-bagger you'll ever get!A while back I wrote to you about what I call ""the biggest lie intechnology today""......and offered you a FREE bulletin on the ONE stock best positioned forenormous gains, as this story unfolds.  A stock that could easily DOUBLEyour money in short order...and then make your fortune several timesover in the next few years.To me, it's CRAZY that I haven't heard back from you.  After all, thisis an entirely FREE piece of information--with no obligation on yourpart.  You have nothing to lose.  And--judging by our gains so far--apile of money to make.Since I started pounding the table for this stock after the Septembercrisis, it's UP 69%!  But DON'T WORRY.  There's still time to get in onthe lion's share of the gains.  The really BIG PROFITS--3 or 4-timeswhat we've made so far--will come as the economy recovers this year.And that's why the perfect time to buy this POWERHOUSE company is NOW.IN JUST A MOMENT, I'll tell you how to get the name of this stock,complete details and my full ""buy instructions""--absolutely FREE,without obligation of any kind.But first, it's imperative that you know the truth about technology'sWHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet slowed down--verynoticeably slowed down.  In fact, it nearly came to a grinding halt!That means there isn't enough capacity or redundancy built into thesystem to accommodate a blip in demand.Sources tell me that the government is very worried about this problem.After all, this is the second time it's happened.  Back in July, atunnel fire in Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two fulldays.That means our communications systems--and therefore our economy--arevery, very vulnerable.  And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than99.9% of Americans even begin to understand.  Here's one example.Qwest--one of America's biggest carriers--recently said they're 60%loaded on their network.  That doesn't sound too bad...until youunderstand how these networks operate.  You can't load a network muchpast 65%.  In fact, 70% is virtually catastrophic--because the networkspends so much time searching for open channels, it doesn't spend anytime actually sending packets of information.The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation comes to astandstill.  And business, the economy and our national security all goin the CRAPPER.BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a ""fiber glut?""  Because95% of all the fiber that has ever been laid is ""dark""--that is, it'snot activated.  And the company I'm recommending is the #1 supplier ofthe components needed to do the job.  I'm looking at a DOUBLE--possiblya TRIPLE by this time next year.  And I fully expect to multiply ourmoney five-times over by 2007.

Don't miss out on the muchBIGGER GAINS to come,At the height of the boom, this company's stock was nearly 20-timeshigher.  But then the economy tanked and spending on communicationsnetworks dried up.  Now the government is ready to pump $100 billion inemergency spending into the economy; interest rates are practicallyzero; and the need isn't just vital for the economy anymore--it's aquestion of NATIONAL SECURITY!

"Rick, thanks for the note. I will be in touch with you and Stefan Diescher onthis. The issue I have been faced with, however, isdemands on my time have been enormous and I have givenViviana as much of my time as possible. Indeed, at the last PRC, there wassignificant pressure to place her in the ""has issues"" categoryand I resisted on the grounds that she needed more time to find her stride.We have had a number of long meetings where I have notedin detail what my expectations are and provided her with suggestions on howto improve. This has included helping her outline a research paperhow to write a slide presentation, what research sources to go to, how toextract information from people on the phone. In a better worldI would spend more time with her to bring her along, but I am horriblystretched and need a researcher who is more effective to helpme get the job done. I have also gotten other feedback (including from thehead of the Frankfurt office) that has been rather negative.My view is that rather than prolong the mutual agony, we should begin theprocess of managing her out and helping her secure moreappropriate employment outside the firm. Please let me know what you think.Thanks, PaulEnron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.I heard more about Viviana before I left London last week and apparently herconcern she was'nt being properly guided or mentored- despite her apparentcurrent performance and your  lack of time, I think we do owe her an actionplan at mid-year at the latest and a decent opportunity to redeem herself.Please let me know how I can be of assistance.

"As we have discussed, I think we probably need someone other than Dan.  Idon't think there is any need to lay everything out on use of lawyers inCanada.  I agree with your comments on the business model for lawyers.  Wecan't ignore that.  Let's generally talk that through with Jim.Regards,MarkPeter Keohane1.  Dan Fournier asked me to go to lunch so he could update me on his ""verypositive meeting"" with Jim and you.  I told Dan, politely, that I am verytired of talking to the issue and really have nothing more to add.  I hopethat is OK with you.  To be honest, I am really tired of talking to the issueand dealing with Dan Fournier's political maneuvering, but I am alsoconcerned that it seems apparent that the result of his meeting with you andJim is that he thinks he is back in the saddle with Enron.  I have lost trustand confidence in Dan Fournier and as I mentioned Dan's approach withinBlakes becomes exclusive and results in inefficient allocation of Blakesresources to our files.  He tries to conquer the client and thereby alienatesthe talent within his firm.  I know for a fact, after he has squeezed othersout on our work and his mismanagement of this issue with Enron, that if Danis back in the saddle, many of his partners will not been keen on doing ourwork under Dan's terms.  I also know that there is a philosophy in Houston tocommercial people not having say in legal retainers, but I believe that thesenior commercial people who are responsible for the transactions,particularly in a smaller office in a smaller market, have an important placein the relationship, and in that regard, I know Fournier has lost the trustand confidence of Rob Milnthorp.2.  Regarding Donahue Ernst and Young, it should be borne in mind that theinitial contact to doing work at their firm was through Jordan Mintz andMorris Clark on the tax side.  I also know Jordan thinks well not just oftheir firm but of the multidisciplinary business model.  I also think thatJim needs to understand that the business model is likely not going away, andlikely to expand in Canada, the US and Europe and is something we likelycannot ignore.  Also, the circumstances you will recall for us using DEYinitially was on regulatory and contracting issues affecting the retailmarket, where the incumbent firms with any experience in the area were allconflicted and in an area where Blakes is particularly weak in Calgary.  (Wefirst approached Stikemans, which had conflict with Enmax, and Bennett Jones,which had a conflict with ATCO.  Other firms which we do not typically usebut which had experience also had conflicts.  After that, I solicited writtenpropsals from both Blakes and DEY and interviewed with them with the retailteam.)  Frankly, DEY has done good work for us.  E&Y is also very wellsituated on the market development side in Ontario, a leading proponent ofderegulation of the Ontario market, and worked with us to set up our systemsin Toronto for market opening.3.  Should I e-mail to Jim a proposed agenda for our call on the 20thoutlining the firms we currently use in different capacities in Canada?Blakes, Bennett Jones, Stikemans, Oslers, Donahue E&Y, or is a less structurdcall anticipated?Peter.Peter.",peter.keohane@enron.com,mark.haedicke@enron.com,Canadian Counsel,True

SDG&E and its parent company, Sempra=20Energy, acknowledged making profits from selling electricity but insisted==20those gains have no bearing on the $750 million debt the utility claims to =be=20owed by customers for power purchases during the energy crisis.  ""Those are==20completely separate transactions,"" said Ed Van Herik, a spokesman for SDG&E=.=20The company's effort to seal a deal with the state to clear the $750 millio=n=20debt has come under attack by the Utility Consumers' Action Network. The Sa=n=20Diego-based consumer group says SDG&E's claimed debt is the result of=20selective bookkeeping, bordering on fraud.  The bottom line, says UCAN, is==20that SDG&E engaged in deception and probably owes its customers money. =20SDG&E, which claimed to have sold customers electricity without markups,=20actually ""was buying electricity at a low price and selling it at a higher==20price to us,"" said Shames. ""SDG&E customers have been systematically lied t=o=20over the past year about this balancing account.""  UCAN says that SDG&E=20earned an estimated $450 million from its power sales to the state, while==20publicly declaring that it was posting only losses from buying power.  Sham=es=20said much of the information leading to UCAN's conclusion came from a=20detailed analysis of documents made available in recent weeks.  The state==20Office of Ratepayer Advocates, meanwhile, yesterday said a new filing by=20SDG&E that claims its power-sales profits belong to stockholders, not=20consumers, is ""specious"" and ""without merit.""  Van Herik insisted the compa=ny=20had not been misleading. The spokesman noted that the company earlier was==20required to buy electricity from the Power Exchange, a now-defunct=20marketplace established by the state as part of its deregulation plan.  ""Wh=at=20we said is that we were buying electricity for our customers and passing=20along the cost without markup,"" said Van Herik.  What SDG&E failed to=20publicly announce was that it was simultaneously selling electricity to the==20Power Exchange for an apparently healthy profit.  Under certain contracts,==20SDG&E had locked in electricity at prices substantially below going rates==20during the ongoing power crisis. The company declined yesterday to reveal==20terms of the contracts. But UCAN estimates the contracts provided electrici=ty=20to the utility at no more than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour.  SDG&E then sold==20that relatively cheap power to the Power Exchange for a higher price and=20pocketed the profit, which it also declined to disclose.  As it profited fr=om=20the power sales, SDG&E bought power at higher prices from the exchange and==20billed customers for what it paid.  Whenever SDG&E's costs to buy electrici=ty=20exceeded what state regulators would allow the utility to charge customers,==20it recorded the amounts in balancing accounts. That account grew to $750=20million.  But SDG&E never offset its losses from electricity purchases with==20its profit from sales.  Van Herik said the practice was appropriate because==20the lucrative contracts for cheap power were owned by the company's=20shareholders, not its customers. The practice of keeping profits and losses==20entirely separate, he said, was endorsed by a California Public Utilities==20Commission audit.  But the first formal ruling on that matter came in June,==20when the full commission ruled that all profits from SDG&E's contractual=20power deals belong to its customers.  SDG&E went to court to overturn the==20commission's ruling, but put the legal effort on hold shortly before Sempra==20reached a tentative agreement with the state to clear the $750 million debt=.=20The proposal with the state would reverse the utilities commission ruling a=nd=20award the company's shareholders ownership of the profits SDG&E made from==20selling power.  Van Herik said yesterday that the state made the concession==20because it recognized that SDG&E had a strong legal case.  But Shames says==20the state had a strong case and noted that the Office of Ratepayer Advocate=s=20agreed. He is asking the utilities commission to reject the deal.  State Se=n.=20Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, said he believes that consumer objections to the==20balancing account deal are aimed at getting ratepayers a better deal -- and==20that's something he supports.  ""If Michael Shames can improve on the=20balancing account deal I'm in full support as long as we don't lose any of==20the gains we've already gotten,"" he said.  A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis==20did not return a telephone call seeking reaction to the UCAN allegations. ==20Outside UCAN's office in Little Italy yesterday, a group of trade unionists==20demonstrated in support of SDG&E's position. Dave Moore, a business manager==20for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 465, said SDG=&E=20has handled its power purchases in accordance with utilities commission=20rulings.  But Shames said the company sought to shield its actions from the==20scrutiny of consumer groups and the public.  ""They consistently said they==20were not making money from this,"" said the consumer advocate. ""For them to==20split hairs and say, 'We didn't make money from purchases, we made it from==20sales,' is disingenuous.""

City officials have awaited Sempra's bid ever since the==20plant would provide enough energy to power almost a half-million homes, and==20the business park would bring higher-paying jobs to a city with the lowest==20median income in North County.

Steve Maviglio confirmed th=at=20on June 20, he bought 300 shares of stock in Calpine Corp., a San Jose-base=d=20power generator that has received about $13 billion in state contracts to==20supply electricity for up to 20 years.  Maviglio's disclosure comes after==20Davis' office hastily ended the contracts of five consultants who helped=20negotiate state power contracts and held stock in energy companies.  In a==20related development, an anonymous source told the Los Angeles Times on Mond=ay=20that the Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary=20inquiry into whether the consultants used inside information to trade the==20energy stocks.  About two dozen Davis energy consultants were required to==20fill out financial disclosure statements after complaints of conflict of=20interest by Republicans and consumer groups.  ""When we reviewed them, we=20found possible violations of the law and took swift action,"" Maviglio said==20Monday before Secretary of State Bill Jones issued a press release calling==20for his termination.  Jones, a Republican, is a candidate for the GOP=20nomination to challenge Davis in November 2002.  Maviglio defended his=20purchase, saying that he ""owns several stocks in companies in all fields th=at=20are growing and are based in California.""  Maviglio said Monday that he=20requested on May 31 to purchase the stock if it dipped to $40 a share, whic=h=20it did two days after a June 18 ruling by federal energy regulators=20restricting wholesale electricity prices in California and 10 other states.==20Maviglio served as Davis' chief spokesman urging the Federal Energy=20Regulatory Commission to impose price ceilings on electricity wholesalers. ==20He also said he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 stock in Houston-based=20Enron Corp. He said he purchased the stock in 1997 and has reported it on==20financial disclosure forms. He said that it is ""closer to $10,000."" =20Meanwhile, two energy consultants to Davis have agreed to forgo more than==20$50,000 in work they did for the state.  Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani will==20forgo the payments as part of a settlement with a Sacramento-area resident==20who filed a lawsuit objecting to their hiring, calling it a conflict of=20interest.  Fabiani could not be reached for comment Monday. In the=20settlement, they admitted no wrongdoing.  Lehane issued a statement through==20the governor's office, calling it ""simply not worth the bother to challenge==20the controller in court.""  Davis has come under fire for his May hiring of==20Lehane, former press secretary for Vice President Al Gore, and Fabiani, a==20deputy campaign manager for Gore's presidential run.  They were hired to he=lp=20shape Davis' response to the energy crisis, and helped craft Davis'=20aggressive attack on Texas-based energy companies and President Bush.  Both==20also have advised Southern California Edison, which is negotiating for stat=e=20help in avoiding bankruptcy. Financial disclosure forms showed they have ea=ch=20received at least $10,000 from Edison in the past year.  Davis announced at==20the end of June that Fabiani terminated his contract, and Davis scaled back==20Lehane's role with the state.  State Controller Kathleen Connell then said==20she would not pay Lehane and Fabiani for any of their work and now the two==20have agreed they will not fight her decision, Maviglio said.  Lewis K.

GOP rival of governor requested the inquiry.By WALTER HAMILTON JEFFERY L. RABIN and DARYL KELLEYTIMES STAFF WRITERSJuly 31 2001The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry==20into whether energy consultants advising Gov. Gray Davis used inside=20information to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the stat=e,=20a source with knowledge of the matter said Monday.The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in=20response to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones. A=20Republican rival of Davis, Jones charged that stock trading by consultants==20may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based on=20information not available to the public.On Friday, top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had be=en=20fired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions a=nd=20their personal finances. As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the=20capital Monday, Davis officials were confronted by a flurry of questions=20about who in the administration owns energy stocks.Financial disclosure records filed by the governor's spokesman, Steve=20Maviglio, show that he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas company==20he and his boss have accused of making ""obscene"" profits while California h=as=20been ""on its knees."" Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houston-based=20Enron Corp. in 1996.""It's not a crime to own energy stock,"" Maviglio said.He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which has the=20largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts.Maviglio placed the order for the stock on May 31, one day after San Jose's==20mayor dropped his opposition to a controversial Calpine plant favored by th=e=20governor and others. Under the terms of Maviglio's purchase, the transactio=n=20was completed about three weeks later when the stock reached $40 a share, a==20value of $12,000. It has since fallen in value.""I viewed it as a good long-term investment,"" Maviglio said, adding that he==20purchased the shares for his retirement account based on publicly available==20information.The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms==20that it has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But=20California's grid operator has identified the company as one of many energy==20merchants to overcharge the state millions of dollars.The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from==20several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show.Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs secretary Barry=20Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that he recently held==20between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state company accused of==20multimillion-dollar price gouging.In a statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month afte=r=20he began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares were==20supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll, but his broker=20failed to do so.In light of the recent disclosures, Secretary of State Jones said the=20governor must do more to ensure the public that its interest comes first.""The governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated=20conflict of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any=20activity since their last statement of economic interest was filed,"" said==20Jones, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor.Word of the SEC's entry into California's energy problems comes as the=20governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for the quick and==20broad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him through the=20crisis.In his written request to the SEC, Jones said that recently filed disclosur=e=20documents showed that at least one consultant bought and sold shares of two==20energy companies within the same month, raising ""a red flag"" about the=20possibility of insider trading.State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving the=ir=20personal financial interests.The five consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter,==20delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was not==20clear which individuals are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether the==20agency's review would result in any charges.Two of the former traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by==20federal investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider==20trading.But William Mead, fired Thursday, said it is no mystery why so many of his==20colleagues owned Calpine stock.Mead said he bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommende=d=20it to his colleagues last year, while they all still worked for the=20now-defunct California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was not=20traded on that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said.Mead and three other energy traders--hired by the state in February and=20March--were terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying pow=er=20for the state from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired traders==20Herman Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of=20their Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to =be=20filed only two weeks ago.""But I'm sure they bought it while they were still at the power exchange,==20because that's when we discussed it,"" Mead said. ""It was kind of like a=20hobby.

For example, Davis's argument th=at=20out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis ha=s=20been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private=20generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that th=is=20amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation betwee=n=20state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's==20chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a hug=e=20overcharge ""has not and cannot be substantiated.""

Gray Davis has begged=,=20cajoled and even threatened legislators and regulators, to lay the groundwo=rk=20for a $12.5 billion bond issue California needs to cover the cost of keepin=g=20its lights on.=20ve=20investment. On that score, Mr. Davis's team, whose credibility has been=20battered by California's months-long electricity crisis, is hoping to bounc=e=20back from a rocky start.=20This week, a delegation headed by state Treasurer Philip Angelides is=20scheduled to visit Wall Street to pitch the municipal debt offering, which==20would be the largest in U.S. history by a factor of nearly four. To succeed=,=20Mr. Angelides will have to allay investors' fears of the kind of political==20infighting that already has delayed the issue several times. He will have t=o=20satisfy bond-rating agencies that the bond is safe enough to merit a top-ti=er=20investment-grade rating. And he'll have to make investors want to buy it=20without demanding costly inducements that would give California financial==20headaches for decades to come.=20""This isn't building the Panama Canal. It's not Apollo 11,"" says Mr.=20Angelides. But, he concedes, the bond sale will be ""uniquely challenging.""==20That is because this giant bond issue won't be backed by the full faith and==20credit of the state or by tax dollars -- the types of guarantees public-deb=t=20investors often prefer. Instead, the bonds, which will have maturities of a=s=20long as 15 years, are to be paid off by the state's electricity ratepayers==20from their monthly bills, which some view as a riskier source of cash flow.==20Moreover, there is still a question as to whether the issue's proceeds will==20be adequate to repay the bonds, restore the state's financially troubled=20private utilities to health and finance future electricity purchases.=20Despite these hurdles, many analysts predict California will eventually=20succeed in pulling off the bond deal, though at a cost far higher than=20originally anticipated. In fact, the apparent easing of the state's energy==20crunch may make its marketing job a bit less difficult. A recent drop in th=e=20price of natural gas, which fuels many California power plants, a mild summ=er=20in the West and a June decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission==20to impose electricity price caps in the region have helped avert the rollin=g=20blackouts that roiled the state earlier this year.=20Still, the specter of history overhangs the bond offering. Rating agencies==20are haunted by having failed to warn investors of such public-finance=20disasters as the 1983 default of the Washington Public Power Supply System==20and the 1994 bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif. Moreover, Moody's Investor=s=20Service and Standard & Poor's assigned investment-grade ratings as recently==20as early January to debt issued by Pacific Gas & Electric Co., just three==20months before the California utility sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court=20protection.=20By the time California hopes to sell its bonds, in October or early Novembe=r,=20the state's electrical-power purchases are expected to leave it owing a tot=al=20of about $10 billion to its lenders and its own general fund. If the bond==20issue is delayed beyond that, or canceled, or if the offering flops,=20California could be forced to make billions of dollars in spending cuts,=20raise taxes or increase electricity rates for the third time in the past ye=ar=20to pay back what it owes.=20If the bond sale fails ""the state of California will be in deep trouble,""==20says Mr. Angelides. ""The state general fund must be repaid so money for=20education, health care and children's services can be safe.""=20California's need for the bonds -- like most of the state's energy woes --==20stems from its troubled 1996 electricity-deregulation plan. Under the plan,==20the state's investor-owned utilities were obliged to sell many of their pow=er=20plants to other companies and purchase electricity through a state-sponsore=d=20power auction. Consumer rates were frozen, but wholesale rates weren't.=20The system worked fairly well until May 2000, when wholesale rates began=20soaring amid tight electricity supplies and stronger-than-expected demand.==20Last year, the state's cost of wholesale power climbed to $27 billion from =$7=20billion in 1999. In the first six months of this year, that sum hit $20=20billion.=20With retail rates frozen, Pacific Gas & Electric, a unit of PG&E Corp., and==20Edison International's Southern California Edison racked up billions of=20dollars of debts. In January, after power generators stopped doing business==20with the utilities, the state began buying power on their behalf. It borrow=ed=20the money from its general fund, normally used to pay for everything from==20public safety and environmental programs to social services and education, =at=20a pace of more than $1 billion a month.=20In February, Mr. Davis's allies in the state Legislature helped him pass a==20bill authorizing the state to sell bonds to replenish the fund and to=20continue making power purchases. But legislators cautiously capped the size==20of the borrowing, using a complex formula. Under the new law, the formula==20would allow only for a bond sale of less than $1 billion.=20Realizing that wasn't sufficient, the governor and the assembly drafted=20another bill that scrapped the formula and allowed the state to sell up to==20$13.4 billion of bonds. But, in a setback for Mr. Davis, Republican lawmake=rs=20banded together to deny him the two-thirds majority needed for the bill to==20immediately become law. As a result, the law won't take effect until=20mid-August, when the public-finance market is all but moribund.=20In the meantime, Mr. Angelides moved to hire underwriters. After receiving==20four dozen bids from Wall Street investment bankers in February, he retaine=d=20a team led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. But under pressure to get the financi=ng=20moving, the treasurer didn't negotiate firm underwriting fees on the deal.==20At the time, Mr. Angelides said he expected the underwriters to ""skinny dow=n""=20their fees given the enormous size of the offering. But Morgan, representin=g=20a team of underwriters that includes Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Citgrou=p=20Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit and Bear, Stearns & Co., says it expects t=o=20charge standard fees, given the significant challenges presented by the=20issue's size. In the case of a $12.5 billion sale, that amounts to around $=56=20million. J.P. Morgan and the California treasurer's office now say the fees==20won't be decided until they determine the bond issue's final size and=20structure.=20From the start, relations between California officials and Wall Street seem=ed=20fraught with miscommunication. In February, Mr. Davis called a meeting to==20explain to institutional investors, analysts and rating-agency executives h=is=20blueprint for getting a grip on California's energy crisis. The session, hi=s=20only face-to-face meeting with investors to date, was held at Manhattan's==20Cornell Club. Attendees say the governor kept them waiting for 20 minutes==20before breezing into the room and giving them only a general overview of th=e=20state's energy plan, which left investors grumbling.=20During the discussion, Mr. Davis, a Bronx, N.Y., native, made light of a=20conversation he had had with Richard Cortright Jr., a Standard & Poor's=20=20getting it,'"" the governor said, according to several people present.=20""It was intended as a joke, but no one was laughing,"" says A.J. Sabatelle, =a=20Moody's vice president. A spokesman for Mr. Davis says the governor doesn't==20recall the exchange; Mr. Davis is frequently late for public engagements. A==20spokesman for Mr. Cortright wouldn't comment.=20Then, in March, the governor's office set up a conference call to update=20investors. Figuring they wouldn't get a big turnout, they used an open-mike==20system that allowed each investor's comments to be heard by everyone else.==20But with around 100 investors taking part, the presentation by Joseph=20Fichera, a paid consultant who is one of Mr. Davis's top financial advisers=,=20turned into a free-for-all, with one caller cursing Mr. Fichera in response==20to one of his answers.=20Infighting among California politicians hasn't helped. Earlier this year, f=or=20example, state Controller Kathleen Connell criticized the way her fellow=20Democrats, Messrs. Davis and Angelides, were handling the bond sale. Unless==20it was far bigger, she warned, the state would face a ""cash-flow crunch"" by==20February or March of 2002. The governor's office fired back, calling her=20claims ""completely"" political.=20California policy makers have ""spent most of the year bickering and finger==20pointing,"" Standard & Poor's director Peter Rigby said in a recent report,==20""and that will raise some uncertainty among lenders."" Moreover, investors==20know the state needs the money, and so ""it's a buyer's market,"" Mr. Rigby==20added.=20Aware that it needed a financial pro to make its case to Wall Street, the==20Davis Administration pushed Mr. Fichera to the forefront. Since May, the=20former Prudential Securities investment banker has spent hours on conferenc=e=20calls with Wall Street explaining the state's strategy. That and a sense th=at=20California has gotten a better grip on its electricity woes indicates that==20""the governor's staff is far higher on the learning curve than just a few==20months ago,"" says Paul Patterson, an electric-power analyst at ABN Amro Inc=.=20Critical barriers remain. The state's Public Utilities Commission has yet t=o=20make key decisions intended to ensure that there's enough ratepayer revenue==20set aside to guarantee that bondholders get paid. On Aug. 23, for example,==20the PUC is expected to take up a rate agreement giving the state's power=20purchaser, the Department of Water Resources, unprecedented authority to=20raise rates without a public hearing. The commission also is expected to=20decide how to divvy up current ratepayer revenue among state and private=20utilities and to take up a measure that would prohibit large industrial=20consumers from, in effect, bypassing the utilities and buying their juice==20directly from generators or traders.=20But opponents of those controversial measures are expected to put up a figh=t.=20Businesses and consumer groups are particularly upset that the state might==20get carte blanche to raise rates and are threatening to sue to block the PU=C=20decision before the state Supreme Court.=20California already has some of the highest electricity rates in the nation.==20Residential consumers in San Francisco, for instance, pay around 14 cents p=er=20kilowatt hour for power, up from about 10 cents in December. That compares==20with around seven cents per kilowatt hour in Atlanta and 10 cents in Chicag=o,=20but it is still lower than the nearly 23 cents charged in New York City.=20High costs are a big reason businesses think they ought to be free to buy==20electricity directly. It's not ""in the best interest of consumers to=20eliminate direct access in order to market bonds that will keep the price o=f=20electricity in California higher than necessary for at least 10 years,"" say=s=20Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce.=20The state's three largest investor-owned utilities, PG&E, SoCalEd and Sempr=a=20Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric Co., are expected to demand the largest==20possible share of the revenues they collect from ratepayers. PG&E, for=20example, has already asked for a public hearing to examine the state's clai=m=20that it needs so much money. The pressure to allocate more cash to the=20utilities could also rise if a state-sponsored bailout plan for SoCalEd fai=ls=20and the utility joins PG&E in bankruptcy proceedings.=20Sorting all these issues out before the PUC may lead to legal challenges th=at=20could delay the bond issuance for months. And potential investors face=20contracts signed by the state, electricity generators and traders involved==20get first call on revenue from ratepayers. Only then would bondholders, who==20are accustomed to being first in line, get paid.=20In fact, some investors who were initially enthusiastic about a bond that i=s=20expected to pay more than half a percentage point above other municipal=20issues in the market are starting to have doubts. Marilyn Cohen, president =of=20Envision Capital in Los Angeles, a firm that manages bond portfolios for=20individual investors, says she spent several months setting aside money to==20participate in the deal. Now, she says, she is starting to look elsewhere. =""I=20don't have confidence that it will get done,"" she adds.=20Many investors are concerned the state hasn't proved it can overcome its=20energy crisis. ""These are the same guys who told us energy prices were goin=g=20south five years ago, they're trying to gloss over the potential problems,""==20says Kelly Mainelli, a portfolio manager at Montgomery Asset Management in==20San Francisco, who is considering investing in the bonds. He says he also==20worries about a spike in natural gas prices ahead of the offering.=20To reassure potential investors, the state now is offering to amass a $3=20billion reserve -- from bond proceeds and ratepayer revenues -- to ensure==20that bondholders would get paid in the event of any unforeseen developments==20in the power market. In addition, California lawmakers are moving a bill=20through the Legislature that would set aside a specific portion of revenues==20from ratepayers solely to pay bondholders. Such an approach could help the==20bond issue ""to get a higher rating,"" says David Hitchcock, director of=20Standard & Poor's state and local government group.=20It might not, however. It isn't clear whether bankruptcy courts can overrul=e=20state government. So, some investors worry that PG&E's bankruptcy judge cou=ld=20rule that money collected by the utility should go to the company's=20creditors, and not to paying investors in the coming bond deal, throwing a==20wrench into the offering. The same would be true in the case of SoCalEd if =it=20ended up filing for Chapter 11 protection.=20Underwriters are moving to broaden the appeal of the planned issue by=20chopping it into small slices aimed at different types of investors. There==20will be taxable, tax-free, variable-interest, fixed-interest, short-term an=d=20long-term bonds. State Finance Director Tim Gage says the state is assuming=a=20rating ""in the range of single-A"" on the power bonds and thus expects to pa=y=20an average annual interest rate of 5.77% on the tax-exempt issue and 7.77% =on=20the taxable bonds.=20Investors and analysts ""may think we're crazy,"" says Guy Phillips, one of t=he=20state's top legislative aides on energy matters, ""But in the end, the=20---=20y=20payments?

In November=,=20it became the taxpayers' turn to be victimized, when the Davis administrati=on=20gave carte blanche authority to the Department of Water Resources for energ=y=20purchases. Between November and July, the department burned through $8=20billion in short-term energy purchases, devouring almost the entire state==20budget surplus. This required the state Public Utilities Commission to pass==20the largest rate hike in California history and will require the state to==20issue $12.4 billion in bonds this fall to service this debt.=20In February, with spot market prices at all-time highs and rolling blackout=s=20rippling through the state, the governor's representatives began to negotia=te=20long-term contracts with the sellers cartel. This was an ill-advised=20long-term strategy to fight a short-run crisis. To understand why, look at==20the negotiating chessboard from the electricity cartel's perspective. The==20cartel's negotiators knew that within 18 to 24 months, there would be a hug=e=20glut of power on the market as many power plants were already under=20construction in California and throughout the West. Once the new energy=20resources were available, the cartel would no longer be able to manipulate==20the market. This supply glut would drive prices back to the 1999 range of==20three to five cents per kilowatt-hour, far lower than the prices now set in==20the long-term energy contracts.=20To the cartel members, this looming power glut was a recipe for heavy losse=s.=20Locking the state into long-term contracts at lucrative rates was their=20redemption. The Davis administration walked into this market inferno,=20bargaining from extreme weakness at the top of the market, signing contract=s=20that were too expensive.

The problem is, the state has had a surfeit of powe=r,=20and it has been selling the juice into the market at a fraction of the pric=e=20it paid, leading to losses from July 1 through Thursday of about $30 millio=n=20to $35 million.=20The losses illustrate the difficulties dogging the state's new energy czar,==20the California Department of Water Resources, despite a softening of=20electricity prices and demand. The department got into the power-purchasing==20business in a big way in January, when the state's biggest investor-owned==20utilities quit buying power because they were no longer creditworthy. Since==20then, the state has signed $43 billion worth of contracts, one for as much =as=2020 years, in a bid to tamp down high spot-market prices. Critics now say it==20was a mistake to lock in so much power at such a high cost.=20Power officials say the state has been in the odd position since last month==20of having too much power contracted for off-peak hours. ""It's something you='d=20expect when you first get into a new business and you'd hope to reduce it,""==20said Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-purchasing agency.=20Internal numbers from the DWR, which the agency has confirmed, show that on==20average the state paid, from July 1 to Thursday, $123 per megawatt hour for==20some 1.8 million megawatts of power purchased under long-term contracts, an=d=20$148 per megawatt hour for some 2.2 million megawatt hours of power purchas=ed=20under short-term contracts. In the same period, the records show it sold=20excess power amounting to 320,000 megawatt hours at an average price of $27==20per megawatt hour, less than what it costs to fuel many plants. At times, t=he=20DWR sold the juice for as little as $2 per megawatt hour.=20This, ironically, has offered an opportunity to power traders that the stat=e=20was seeking to hem in through its contract program. They have been able at==20times to substitute cheap power they buy from the state for the more costly==20power they otherwise would have to generate to meet their contract=20obligations.=20Despite the agency's power-trading losses, total market costs still are dow=n=20substantially from previous months, partly due to price limits set June 19 =by=20the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Slacker demand also has been a=20factor. In June, Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International=,=20sold 11.8% less electricity to its customers than in June 2000, reflecting==20energy conservation and reduced demand for air conditioning.=20Since January the state has spent $9.5 billion buying power at an average==20cost of $237 per megawatt hour, according to internal DWR documents. That i=s=20more than double the price of wholesale electricity last year, when prices==20averaged $114. The state's cash-strapped utilities have reimbursed the agen=cy=20$1.53 billion of the $9.5 billion it has spent so far. As a result of the==20huge shortfall, the state has tapped California 's general fund and now is==20pursuing a plan to sell $12.5 billion worth of revenue bonds to replenish i=ts=20coffers.=20The state signed dozens of long-term power contracts after January, pushed =by=20federal energy regulators to protect itself against spot-market volatility.==20So far this year, it has spent $851 million under long-term contracts, $2.3=6=20billion under short-term arrangements and $5.54 billion on spot-market=20purchases, according to the DWR documents.=20But the state's ""long"" position in July, in which it had too much power, ha=s=20at times given power-trading companies an arbitrage opportunity. Last=20Wednesday, for example, the state sold electricity for as little as $2 per==20megawatt hour on the same day that it was paying $22 to $75 on the spot=20market, presumably because its advance purchases did not exactly match the==20actual shape of demand.=20John Stout, senior vice president for Houston-based Reliant Energy Inc., a==20big energy supplier to California , said a trader can double or triple his==20company's profit by substituting cheap market power from the water-resource=s=20agency for power the company otherwise would generate.

"Rick Richard sent an Email to you of 1/5/0l recommending support of DarylOwen and Don Santa for positions with the Department of Energy.   Steve Keanasked that we give you background on these candidates, and Joe Hartsoe andCynthia Sandherr significantly contributed to this response.  In sum, DonSanta is an excellent candidate for the DOE and has a well established recordsupporting competition in the gas and electric industries.  Daryl Owen, whilea strong candidate, has a less established record on competition.Daryl Owen, Principal at Hooper Owen and Winburn seeks the position of DeputySecretary at DOE.  He is a Democrat from Louisiana who is a family friend ofRick Richard's.  He formerly served as an Energy Legislative Assistant andAdministrative Assistant to Senator J. Bennett Johnston (D-LA) from 1981-86;and Staff Director, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources from1986-1990.  He has been with first Hooper, Hooper and Owen and now Hoper Owenand Winburn since he left the Hill.  His partner, Lindsay Hooper, was formerTax Legislative Assistant and Legislative Director to Senator Malcolm Wallop(R-WY), 1980-1984.  Other partners include former Congressman Charlie Wilson(D-TX).Daryl's current clients include Duke Energy, Entergy Corp., Entergy Services,Inc., Japan Nuclear Cycle Development Institute, TECO Energy, United PanEurope and Waste Control Specialists, Inc..  The firm's energy clientsinclude Coastal Corp and the ANR Pipeline.One potential confirmation concern could track the problem his formerpartner, Nancy Dorn, encountered after Speaker Hastert  announced his intentto hire her to work for him.  Specifically, there was negative WashingtonPost front page press coverage concerning the work the firm does for theEmbassy of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Coastal, and the Government of theIslamic Republic of Pakistan.  Specifically, Pakistan is an issue due to itsnuclear proliferation.  Further, you may recall, other former Coastalemployees had difficulties clearing the confirmation process in the ClintonAdministration due to the company's Libya Sanctions violations.On the political side, Secretary Designate Abraham has quietly told hisformer chief of staff that he needs a Deputy strong on nuclear defenseissues.  Further, unless the Bush-Cheney team tells him differently, he wouldprefer to not have a Democrat in the Deputy slot.  Spence Abraham is meetingwith the Bush-Cheney folks on Thursday, January 11th to discuss who hasselection rights.  Until then, no decisions will be forthcoming.Daryl knows much about the oil and gas industry.  As expected, he had strongties to the producer community as a Capitol Hill staffer.  However, he hasnot been particularly active in the electricity restructuring debate onbehalf of his clients.Donald (Don) F. Santa, Jr., Senior Vice President for Strategic Planning forLG&E Corp. (1997-2001) seeks the position of FERC Chairman or a seniorposition at DOE.  He formerly served as Senior Vice President, Deputy GeneralCounsel at LG&E Energy where he managed its public policy group and the legalmatters for its energy marketing business.  Prior to that, he served fouryears as a  FERC Commissioner (1993-1997) with and  appointment as anIndependent.  During his tenure, the Commissioner adopted severalpro-competition Orders, including Nos. 636 and 888.  He also formerly servedas Counsel  to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee (1989-1993)for Senator J. Bennett Johnston (D-LA).  Prior to that, Don was an associateattorney with Van Ness, Feldman, Sutcliffe & Curtis (1985-1989.)Don served as the Chairman of the Electric Power Supply Association's(EPSA's) Regulatory Affairs Committee where he strongly advocated the samepositions as Enron on electric industry restructuring issues.  It is rumoredthat Texas PUC Chairman Pat Wood now wants FERC Chair since Colin Powell'sson appears a certainty for FCC Chairman.  If this is the case, Don would bean excellent DOE candidate.Finally, although Spence Abraham is expected to be confirmed after hishearing on January 18th, Democrats on the Committee intend to speak againsthim for his prior support of legislation to close the Department of Energy.As such, his confirmation is not a ""sure thing.""Don would likely not be present the Transition Team with vettingirregularities and poses no apparent confirmation concerns.  Cynthia hasheard from some close to him that he might not be interested in anAdministration job because it requires a major salary reduction.  Don is anative of Connecticut who received his J.D. from Columbia University Schoolof Law and his B.A. from Duke University.","kenneth.lay@enron.com, steven.kean@enron.com",linda.robertson@enron.com,DOE Rich Richard Recommendations,True
"Ken,I feel terrible in writing this email to inform you that I am leaving Enron.The timing of my departure is purely coincidental to the timing of the recentevents.It has been a special and rewarding privilege to work at Enron over the pastthree and a half years.  The integrity and high purpose you stand for is apersonal inspiration to me.  Seeing your leadership first-hand has been areal treat.Receiving the Chairman's Award last year was an incredible honor.  It isdifficult for me to feel truly deserving of it because of the sheer numbersof amazingly dedicated, yet unrecognized heroes I have met at Enron.  I havethe greatest admiration of them and draw my inspiration from them.One regret in leaving is that there will be those at Enron who will use mydeparture as more negative fodder to taint the company image.  I wouldn'tever wish that on you, especially in light of the recent challenges you areexperiencing.  So I apologize if that does come to pass.One factor in my departure has been my disappointment with personnel abusesI've observed with EES' origination management.  There is a general feelingof despair because the management chain looks the other way and the conceptof an ""open door"" is political suicide.  H.R. is as much at fault in myopinion because they side with management as opposed to taking an objectiveview and judgement of the abuses.  My words and credibility may not carryany weight as I too have been victimized by the character assassinationthat is all too common at EES.Though my emotions run high when I think about the injustices to good employees(and lost potential benefit to Enron), I leave with no bad feelings toward the companyand am proud to have been a part of Enron.The shift in EES' business model had resulted in my taking on a new role thispast spring.  Being based outside of Houston (in the Chicago area), my careeropportunities are limited.  And as much as I tried, I was feeling stale andunfulfilled in this new role and decided that it would be better for me tomove on.Ken, I believe in you and wish you success and redemption through this difficulttime.

Our negative checking balance needs some injection of cash andMelissa had hoped to use the money to buy a few things for Christmas thisweek as well.   If you haven't already, I'm sure that you can broach thesubject with Mama without letting her know that I asked.Anyway,  Melissa really wanted to be able to paint more and is upset that shewasn't able to ""prove"" to Mama that she is willing and able to work hard.She still gets those not so subtle jabs all the time from Mama about notworking outside the home.  For the record, she busts her ass keeping ourhouse clean, clothes washed and ironed, meals cooked, and doing lots ofthings to make sure we have a happy, healthy, and well adjusted son.   Ifthere is a way (later) that you can subtly encourage Mama to hold back onthese jabs when we next visit, it will go a long way toward ensuring a goodChristmas for everyone.Anyway, definitely keep all of this confidential between me and you.  Thereis no major problem here but I wanted to check off with you on this so we canhelp keep everything going smooth and folks getting along.

"scott.neal@enron.com, mike.grigsby@enron.com, mike.maggi@enron.comFrom Dynegy call on Monday..This is a brief of the referenced conference call.  Notes were taken by our assistant from Producer Finance.jempy..Just received this.Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.EES will be a part of the new company.Enron assets will be revalued at closing.The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling.The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.","Childers, Craig; Boudreaux, Jay","Stork, Colette",Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call,False

"Don't know if you saw this already.  Interesting.KenIndigestionDaniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01All those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not.For natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE's Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid.Ah, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as $10 last year. (A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation's electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen.Studness determined that 79% of the ""new"" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there's plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand.Addressing a Burning IssueIf natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn.WINNERS  			Sales* ($bil) 	RemarksCalpine 				$4.6 		Its gas power plants won't compete with coal for yearsChesapeake Energy 		0.9 		Hedged gas production through December 2003Dynegy 			43.4 		Owns gas, coal power plants; stores, trades gasPeabody Energy 		2.7 		World's largest coal companyLOSERS  			Sales* ($bil) 	RemarksDevon Energy 			3.3 Gas-heavy; 	$8 billion in ...debtGeneral Electric 		129.5 		Sells gas turbinesPioneer Natural Resources 	1.0 		$1.5 billion in ...debt; 53% of production is gasTransocean SedcoForex 	1.9 		$4 billion in debt; heavy gas-drilling exposure""It's not our game to compete with coal or nuclear,"" says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build gas-fired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. ""It's our game to displace older gas.""Combined-cycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. The oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500. Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day.That scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houston-based Dynegy, an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. Dynegy's 35-year-old coal plants are ""huge capital hogs,"" Bergstrom says, that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. Throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down, Bergstrom says.But coal-plant owners can be ingenious. Witness Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. By changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output from the 40-year-old plants 12% last year--while reducing emissions. John Long, vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks he can coax another 15% increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules.","mike.grigsby@enron.com, k..allen@enron.com, martin.cuilla@enron.com",ken.shulklapper@enron.com,Forbes Article-Gas Fired Power Plants,False

I think we might have a misunderstanding on theseparation of roles between ECC and ENA.  ECC legal will do the legal work inassisting the Calgary confirm desk in preparing the actual confirms,amendments, terminations, etc.  However, ENA legal will continue to handleall legal matters or inquiries with respect to the negotiation andinterpretation of the contracts surrounding the confirms which, I assume,would include the negotiation and interpretation of matters such as thefinancial GTC forms.  Therefore, I would suspect that the negotiation of theterms of the GTC between ECC and PowerEX, for example, would still be handledby ENA.  Also, as a result, I would suspect that the guarantees would also becoordinated with Clement through ENA.  Perhaps Mark Taylor can clarify onthese points.CheersGregMARY COOKWill you be coordinating with Enron Corp.

In addition, Sempra waived its right to utilizeits call option for 21,500 MMBtu/d of capacity at $0.30/MMBtu during thistwo-year period.TW also sold 14,000 MMBtu/d of firm transport to Calpine for two yearsbeginning Jan. 1, 2004 at a floating rate based on the difference between theCalifornia border and the San Juan Blanco indices.  The primary deliverypoint is Calpine's newly constructed power plant on the Topock lateral.  Thefloating price can currently be hedged to yield a gross margin of$0.80/MMBtu, with a contract value (net of fuel) of $6.1MM.BP/Amoco was one of several interested parties last week as TW marketed theremaining large blocks of our East capacity.  BP has come back to TW with anoffer, based on available space, of $0.02/MMBtu for demand plus a sharingmechanism for alternate deliveries west.  The proposed term is for 2001 April- October.  We are working with Facility Planning to determine the availablespace.Gas Inventory - TW continued to experience high line pressure and pack outwest this week.

They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would rollback retail powerrates to levels seen prior to deregulation .Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to 6.5cents perkilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & ElectricCo. can becharged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other reasonablecosts to thatcommodity price.The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is farhigher than theaverage price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's markethas beenderegulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained bythe utility from astate-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents,respectively, comparedwith the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier.Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a nearmutiny. Therate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, aswell as toschools and hospitals.In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward bythe CaliforniaPublic Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature earmarked$150 million ofgeneral-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costsif they greatlyexceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would beexpected to makeup any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost.Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & ElectricCo., said therate-cap measure is ""deeply flawed"" because it limits the amount prices canrise but setsno floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism forcustomers to payit down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last untilDecember 2002 orDecember 2003.Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664million, providedfuture prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward pricesthroughDecember 2002. ""It's irreparably damaging to Sempra,"" he said because it""createstremendous uncertainty"" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy companyto financenew projects such as a new transmission line.The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up thepermit process for theconstruction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs ofregulatory agencies thatreview the plans.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

We would be happy to have a tele-conference to go through this proposal with you.  You will also note that the latter part of the presentation begins to outline additional options (on a notional value basis) that we can put into a deal to increase the value of the deal over the proposed 10-year term.We took a look at the strategic value of the underlying assets that were offered and were unfortunately not able to come up with a structure that we could support for either the purchase or re-capitalization of KNG Energy's assets.  We appreciate the opportunity to bid on these assets and are happy to work with you to optimize our proposal to fit the ultimate owner's needs for expansion.I have also attached our group's brochure and a copy of a recent article about our group in Gas Daily.

The sky is still black. Theworld is still asleep. The day is coming.In a few moments the day will arrive. It will roar down the track withthe rising of the sun. The stillness of the dawn will be exchanged for thenoise of the day. The calm of the solitude will be replaced by the poundingpace of the human race. The refuge of the early morning will be invaded bydecisions to be made and deadlines to be met.For the next twelve hours I will be exposed to the day's demands. Itis now that I must make a choice. Because of Calvary, I'm free to choose.And so I choose.I choose love... No occasion justifies hatred; no injustice warrantsbitterness, I choose love. Today I will love God and what God loves.I choose joy... I will invite my God to be the God of circumstance. Iwill refuse the temptation to be cynical...the tool of the lazy thinker. Iwill refuse to see people as anything less than human beings, created byGod. I will refuse to see any problem as anything less than an opportunityto see God.I choose peace... I will live forgiven. I will forgive so that I maylive.I choose patience... I will overlook the inconveniences of the world.Instead of cursing the one who takes my place, I'll invite him to do so.Rather than complaining that the wait is too long, I will thank God for amoment to pray. Instead of clinching my fist at new assignments, I will facethem with joy and courage.I choose kindness... I will be kind to the poor, for they are alone.Kind to the rich, for they are afraid. And kind to the unkind, for such ishow God has treated me.I choose goodness... I will go without a dollar before I take adishonest one. I will be overlooked before I will boast. I will confessbefore I will accuse. I choose goodness.I choose faithfulness... Today I will keep my promises. My debtorswill not regret their trust. My associates will not question my word. Mywife will not question my love. And my children will never fear that theirfather will not come home.I choose gentleness... Nothing is won by force. I choose to be gentle.If I raise my voice may it be only in praise. If I clench my fist, may it beonly in prayer. If I make a demand, may it be only of myself.I choose self-control... I am a spiritual being. After this body isdead, my spirit will soar. I refuse to let what will rot, rule the eternal.I choose self-control. I will be drunk only by joy. I will be impassionedonly by my faith. I will be influenced only by God. I will be taught only byChrist. I choose self-control.Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,gentleness, and self-control. To these I commit my day. If I succeed, I willgive thanks. If I fail, I will seek His grace.

Keep going past the intersection by the Texacostation and turn right at your next opportunity (i.e. Roberts Road).  Youwill see an ""Oakwood Homes"" pre-fab housing lot on the corner of 290 andRoberts Road.  Turn right at RobertsRoad, and go about 8/10 of a mile to Zube park (on your right).Park in the Northwest corner of the parking lot.GROUPS OF 10-15 RIDERS ARE SENT OUT BASED ON RIDE SPEED, STARTING WITH THEFASTER RIDERS AND WORKING DOWN TO THE MORE LIESURLY PACED RIDERS.  THERE ARESEVERAL ROUTES TO CHOSE FROM, 33, 48, 62 . . . ITS YOUR CHOICE. IF YOU ARENEW TO OUR RIDE, PLEASE PICK UP A MAP. MAPS ARE PROVIDED AT EVERY RIDE.THE NEW RIDER GROUP IS GEARED FOR NEW RIDERS. THE RIDE COORDINATOR WILL TAKETHE GROUP OUT ON A ROUTE DETERMINED AT THE START OF THE RIDE. NO RIDER GETSLEFT BEHIND IN THIS GROUP. THIS IS A GREAT GROUP TO RIDE WITH IF YOU ARE NEWHere is the Conoco series, sponsored by Steve Moskowitz - This is ride #12,Scales at Enron - 713-345-3673.You read the note right - it says we're starting from COLUMBUS, Tx!Sorry this note is a day late and still missing a key detail - the exactstarting location - but due to the Round Top/Warrenton Antique Fair (100,000visitors/day), we felt we needed to modify our route this Saturday.  Thereis a hilly 56 mile route which starts in Columbus and covers many of thesame challenging hills as the ride originally planned but stays away fromRound Top, Warrenton, and Fayetteville and the busy roads immediately aroundthese towns.Weekly Ride - Columbus, TX, Sat, 3/31 - 8 amThis week, we'll still get our hill training in and will have theopportunity to climb the same hill (Lone Oak) that we would have had toclimb on the New Ulm route.  This ride is a 56 mile loop starting inColumbus, hitting Lone Oak and Frelsburg and picking up beautifulZimmerscheidt Road going the other direction.  The Rides Around Houston bookgives this ride a score of ""9"" for exercise potential so look for somehills.Houston Tolway/I-10 intersection so please allow yourself time to arrive inDirections to the Start - Beason's ParkWe have permission to use Beason's Park as the starting off point.  Someonewould be gone by then and we didn't really need the pavilion.  Beason's Parkdoes have restrooms, however, I will not vouch for the condition.Beason's park is on US 90 just east of Columbus.  The most direct way is totake I-10 to exit 698 (US 90 exit) and take US 90 west.  The park is on theleft hand side of the road just before the bridge over the Colorado river.For those of you (like us) coming from Magnolia/The Woodlands the best wayis to take FM 949 to I-10.  We stay on the feeder which becomes US 90 atexit 698.If you want to pick up food or go to the bathroom before the ride, stay onI-10 until exit 696 (Hwy 71).  There are convenience stores and bathrooms atthis exit.  At this point you can either take Hwy 71 north to US 90 and turnright (east) to get to the park (which will be on your right just after thebridge) or get back on I-10 to exit 698.NOTE - As we get out into the country, I highly recommend stopping at thelocal stores for your sport drinks, water, and a quick rest stop.  Yourdrinks will be colder this way, you will have a timely rest stop, and thelocal business will look forward to our return.Here's a few reminders for those of you who are new to the list or have asigning in, you'll get left at the start this week.  PLEASE allow time toWarrenton, we want to be off the roads as early as possible.Check-in ProcessEvery rider is expected to sign in to indicate that they have started theride and sign-out on their return.  We have no way of knowing that you areon the road and may need assistance if you don't sign in.  PLEASE arriveearly enough to sign in and remember to sign out when you finish the ride.If you have completed the online or paper waiver, your name will appear onthe alphabetical sign-in sheets.  They are split up into groups of 5-6sheets to speed up the sign in process so look for the clip board with yourname.  If this is your first ride and you haven't signed up online, you needto complete a paper waiver and fill in your name on the blank sign-in sheet.If you completed a paper waiver last Saturday and your name is not listed onthe alpha list, it's because you didn't sign the waiver (3 of you), yousigned one but didn't provide any emergency information, or I just couldn'tread your handwriting (5 VERY sloppy waivers last week!).  PLEASE arriveearly enough to fill out a legible waiver or slow down a minute when fillingit out.I hate to harp on these details but it is vital that everyone help out toensure that you have a safe and fun ride.Thanks!Stephen MoskowitzConoco Inc.(281) 293-2599steve.e.moskowitz@usa.conoco.com",Amelia Alder/OTS/Enron@ENRON,joannie.williamson@enron.com,THREE WEEKS TO SHOWTIME !!,True

There were 8 city, county, state and federal agencies notified byapplication for approval to construct the 9 mile pipline system consisting of3 piplines.  This is the only agency approval received as yet.Acre credits were obtained from Aera for the construction of the Rogaspipeline.  Aera is an oil company with major holdings of acreage availablefor purchase.  It was felt that due to the time constraints for initiatingthis project and the concern with not receiving the credits from the F&G thatEOTT would purchase Aera credits to ensure procurement of the necessaryacreage for the Rogas project.  This is a major plus for the project.The rough draft of the baseline noise survey for the turbine installations inAz. was received.  Some changes will be made in each document.,  as thecontractor has made some obvious conclusions and asumptions which are notvalid or representative of the mitigation Transwetern will do.  The NavajoNation has requested that an onsite survey be conducted at the C/S on thereservation (C/S 3 and 4)  for T&E plants and animals and archeology.  Acontractor has been notified and surveys will be completed by 3/12. The F-1environmental report  for the FERC application will be submitted to Donna bythis friday.The air permit applications for C/S 1 and 2 have been started.   A meetingwith EPA in San Francisco has abeen set to discuss permitting the C/Sfacilities on the reservation on 3/20.  After the meeting, applicationsshould be in front of the Navajo air permitting agency and the EPA within aweek. Air permits are expected  within 5-7 months after submittal of theapplication.  During a conference call this week, a proposal was submitted toremove the existing auxillary generators and replace with 2 units at eachlocation.  This will delay submittal of the air applications 3-4 days,assuming no major issues result.

Ratepayers there are payingmarket-based rates forelectricity and have seen their utility bills nearly triple in the past twomonths.The price cap would need to be approved by the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission before it goesinto effect at the Power Exchange.

Click on the link below to view a pdffile containing the 27 page decision.In summary, the Court's tentative ruling is to deny the QF's request tosuspend the PPA's, to decline to set a deadline for PG&E to assume or rejectthe contract and to find that the reasonable rate that PG&E must pay the QFfor energy delivered post petition pending assumption or rejection is therate determined by the CPUC in the Wood decision.The Court then goes on to note that this case is an extraordinary onerequiring extraordinary relief.  The Court therefore tentatively ruled thatPG&E should pay some undetermined portion of the pre-petition arrearages tothe QF's in order to ameliorate the burden on the QF's and help get them back(or keep them) online.The Court therefore ordered PG&E, MidSet and the Committee to meet and conferand attempt to reach a resolution of the amount of the arrearage to be paid.Judge Montali states that ""he has it in mind"" that the amount perhaps shouldbe equal to the difference between the Wood rates and the market price.Call me if you have any questions or have an trouble with the link.Ben Young79/4799756092ca99bf88256a4a00045971?OpenDocumentBennett G.

Our CEO and VP of Sales will beattending a meeting with CheMatch in Houston in mid to late January.  Aswell, interest has been shown from the Natural Gas Exchange (www.ngx.com) andAutomated Power Exchange (www.apx.com).  From our discussions, it has becomeapparent that these two sites currently deal with Enron at some level andboth agree that the Cavio Solution could effect a positive change in the lagtime currently seen for billing cycles (up to 55 days) as well as providingother benefits.  I feel that with Enron and CheMatch setting a new standardwith Cavio, many of your current clients will be eager to join, and yourcompetition will be left behind.Based on the fact that you had expressed interest in Cavio and Beta testingthe Cavio Solution for trades currently happening between Cheats and Enron,I think that it may be an ideal time to plan a meeting with your team inconjunction with our meeting with CheMatch.Please advise as soon as possible.Thanks.Geoff KershawBusiness Development ManagerCavio CorporationPhone   (604) 484-4700 Ext. 4713Fax        (604) 484-4701Email    gkershaw@cavio.comWeb       www.cavio.com----------------------------------------------------------------------------and may contain confidential and privileged information.

Connie Lausten of the U.S. House Government ReformCommittee made a request to Enron's DC office to see the trading flooroperations in addition to holding a discussion about Enron Online.  She is tomeet with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor on Friday, July 13th at 9am.  JohnShelk from our DC office told me when people on the Hill say ""Enron OnLine""they mean not only the online trading platform itself, but the broadersubject of financial products and energy  trading, whether online orotherwise.  John said that the interest coming from the Hill is broader thanthe platform alone and reflects in many ways a lack of understanding of thebenefits of what we do in this area.  We will be coordinating this with theDC office.Please call me with any comments at 37007.","louise.kitchen@enron.com, greg.whalley@enron.com, andy.zipper@enron.com,",christi.nicolay@enron.com,EOL,False

Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.EES will be a part of the new company.Enron assets will be revalued at closing.The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling.The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.Patrick Tucker","Pollan, Sylvia S.; Culotta, Lindsay; Murrell, Russell E; Plachy, Denver; Cuilla, Martin; Storey, Geoff; Yawapongsiri, Virawan; Mahmassani, Souad; Donohoe, Tom; Ruscitti, Kevin; Shively, Hunter S.; Lewis, Andrew H.; Giron, Darron C.; Frihart, Bryant; Tucker, Patrick; Roberts, Linda; Luce, Laura; Hogan, Irena D.; Vickers, Frank; Williams, Jason (Trading); Mims, Patrice L.; Simpson, James; Hodge, John; Keavey, Peter F.; Mckay, Brad; Mckay, Jonathan; Pereira, Susan W.; Pimenov, Vladi; Ring, Andrea; Savvas, Leonidas; Townsend, Judy; Versen, Victoria; Barbe, Robin; Concannon, Ruth; Goodell, Scott; Jones, David; Kaiser, Jared; Loving, Scott; Bates, Kimberly; Muhl, Gil; Smith, Maureen; Smith, Shauywn; Taylor, Craig; Willis, Jim","Tucker, Patrick",Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call,False

"Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=r imagined when we made these investments;-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=stand financial and operating disclosures; and-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=usly reported earnings.We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=Core BusinessesOur core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=.I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=mprovement in our counterparty relationships.Non-Core BusinessesOur non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=return from them has been dismal.We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.Businesses Under ReviewThese businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=ecomes available.Credit Rating/10-Q FilingWe continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating.

"USGTSold 20,000 MMBtu/d of Daily Firm space moving gas for the weekend from PG&ETopock to SoCal Needles at $.10/MMBtu.  This was somewhat of a novel deal inthat the California price spreads opened up and gas became trapped at PG&E.Once our station 4 compressor becomes fully operational, this opportunitywill likely dry up.Enron N.A.Representatives contacted us this week to discuss our possible participationin a gas storage field using a depleted reservoir on Navajo land nearFarmington, NM.  Third party developers approached ENA looking for assistancein moving the project forward.New Tariff ServicesMarketing consensus was reached to delay any further development ofTranswestern's Hourly Firm Service until the potential markets of power plantloads become operational.  During this interim period, Park 'n Ride servicesprovided on an intra-day basis shall be priced incrementally higher than Park'n Ride services provided on a timely basis.  Any resulting market responsewill provide indications of market willingness to pay premium transport ratesfor hourly transportation service.El PasoEl Paso Merchant Services needs to re-scrub their verbal offer toTranswestern of a $15 Million lump sum ""pre-payment"" option of fuelmonetization for their combined 65,000 MMBtu/d of San Juan to Californiacapacity.  El Paso did not take into consideration the different terminationdates of the two contracts (25,000 MMBtu/d PG&E permanent release contract,and 40,000 MMBtu/d Gallup expansion contract) in their analysis.  A revisedproposed lump sum payment offer is expected mid-next week.El Paso Field ServicesMet with EP representatives to discuss a possible interconnect near WT-1.The I/C would be sized for 40,000 MMBtu/d.  EP proposes to pay for and setcompression to flow this gas into our high pressure line and has agreed to avolume commitment of 20,000 MMBtu/d for up to 2 years.  An added advantage ismost of the volume would come from the constrained Atoka area which wouldallow Agave to increase deliveries to TW.Caithness Corp.Caithness has decided to move forward on their 1000 Mw generation project inNorthwest Arizona.  The 2-phase project would initially consume 80,000MMBtu/d of gas.  The proposed location is 40 miles south of TW's line nearWickieup, AZ.  We are meeting with Caithness reps next week.  Projectedin-service date for the plant is early 2002.WT-2 Cooler ExpansionLevel B cost estimates are being prepared.  Revenue / cost savingsassumptions predict $500,000 annual revenue to support the expenditure.  Onceinstalled, the project would give TW an additional 50,000 MMBtu/d capacity onthe east end.  Financial evaluations will be done once the cost estimate isreceived.NGPL Winkler InterconnectNGPL notified us this week the reactivated point should be operationallyready to flow gas on July 17 (about 2 weeks ahead of schedule).

"Jamie --Thank you for keeping me in the loop on your activities.  While I am always supportive of more public statements pushing competition, neither I nor Enron can sign on to the letter.First, I am concerned that having Enron sign on will distract from your messages.  Enron is a ""hot button"" in DC and will change the proper focus.In addition, I would argue that the recommendation for a national commission is out of place with the current timing of FERC and Congressional action -- which is imminent -- while a commission would delay action on the Hill and at FERC, thus supporting the forces against competition.  Let's not study this too much - we know what to do.  Move away from the commission.Also, I'm not sure how providing federal grant money only to states that promote competition supports our efforts.  Making GA pay for PA is a distraction from the main fights at FERC and on the Hill.Finally, I would guess that more funds to FERC and other agencies will only be used to increase enforcement against those in the industry.  While Enron wants markets that work well, the core problem is that we haven't deregulated enough - not that markets aren't working.Also, I don't know where the recommendation numbers from the Bush/Cheney plan came from -- I think it was an earlier document -- there are no such numbers in the final printed version of the report that I have.If you want to talk, please let me know.Thanks,Jim",jwimberly@caem.org,d..steffes@enron.com,Letter from Leadership Council to Bush WH,False

Forgetting the question Legal may or may nothave (let's assume they don't have any concerns) about Scott testifying, itis still my opinion that we should not file testimony. I will adjust myschedule to meet with you.First, I assume that you have already marked your book to the Lynch""thoughts"" on rate design and revenue allocation included in the initialOrder.   I make this assumption, because the loss to EES has already occurredand our goal now is to try and bring back some of the value by (a) focusingon revenue sharing and (b) rate design.  Scott indicates that the loss couldbe $100MM with bad outcomes on the 2 key issues.  My purpose of EES' activityis to try and minimize that number.  I feel that a quiet but forceful role inthe case is the best vehicle given our recent troubles in CA and before theCPUC.  We have a reserve set aside for the actual outcome of the rate case.Second, I am not sure that Govt Affairs is comfortable with Scott's model ofrate design.  While tiering of rates is on the table, the question of demandreduction payback under his framework could result in customers using 70% oftheir load and paying nothing.  That hardly makes sense.  Now maybe we justdon't understand, but putting in testimony that is unclear or confusing isn'tgoing to win the day before the CPUC.  When we talk with you this morning, weshould be able to get you comfortable.  If we cannot agree, then we shouldsit down with Don and Janet.Third, most of our victory will come from aligning with the big users.  If weare supporting / defending our own testimony (which they haven't seen), Ithink that our ability to work through a Settlement will be limited.  Ourgoal is to ""pick and choose"" from the best solutions proposed while trying tohighlight other options through cross-examination (granted, this may be veryhard).   We should have a list of the best to worst outcomes for Enron andshould work to get the best possible outcome.Fourth, someone may try to get EES to weigh in on the allocation of thesecosts to DA customers.  We have agreed not to take on that issue.  Scottdoesn't get to use the Fifth Amendment to not answer. Let's discuss strategyScott and his team is preparing testimony.  Give me a call.  If Scott and youare intent on moving forward, we'll do as you see fit within the otherconstraints.Jim---------------------- Forwarded by James D Steffes/NA/Enron on 04/12/2001Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Tamara Johnson/HOU/EES@EES, RobertNeustaedter/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, JeffDasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRONHere is the list of pros and cons for Scott Stoness filing testimony in theCPUC rate design case (testimony due tomorrow, hearing set to begin nextMonday).  We have a call into Mike Smith to get legal's view.Getting out on the table a demand reduction program and a market-basedpricing mechanismFavorable ""strawman"" proposal can move direction of CPUC decision in our favorInsurance policy in case no one files a proposal we likeCan be withdrawn before hearing if we have other proposals we can supportCould give us leverage to participate in settlement negotiationsEasier to make case through direct testimony than on cross exam.We get in a position of having to defend our position and loose ability tothrow support behind other positive proposals (alone or in combination)We open ourselves to cross examlination and discovery  (Scott Stoness will besupporting witness and could have information we would not want revealed).Enron is not very popular these days and filing/testimony could fuel morenegative pressAdditional Enron resources will be used (Scott's time, Tamara's time)Market dysfunction may help ENA's positionScott Stoness estimates that there is a $50 million risk if dollars are notapportioned properly to each rate class, but this is an issue that a numberof parties will likely be addressing in their testimony.  He estimates thatthere is an additional $50 million at risk if CPUC's seasonal rate design isadopted as opposed to his two-part real time pricing proposal.  $100 millionpotential loss if Lynch proposal does not solve the problem for the winter of2001-2002 and anothe rate increase is needed in November.","Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Mike D Smith/HOU/EES@EES",58 PM,pros and cons,True

I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.Now it's time to look forward.With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.",all.worldwide@enron.com,ken.lay-@enron.com,Organizational Announcement,True

"complaintI'm concerned about the 2nd bullet.  We've been taking the position that we don't want this ""payment of PX credit"" issue in this proceeding -- the ""free-for-all"" proceeding. Have we changed our position?  If not, I am concerned that Edison will either state directly or give the impression that it's part of the Barnett proceeding..ok.OK.  Haven't heard back from Bob, but we may be able to avoid the call.  Mike Day got in touch with Edison's attorney this morning and here's the end result.Edison has agreed to tell the judge on the 7th that, with respect to the complaints we've filed, they agree to take them off calendar until and unless parties ask to put them back on calendar.Edison will  take the view that the proceedings underway at the commission (and presumably attempts to ""settle"" with parties) will resolve the issues in the complaint.The assumption from out end is that the status quo remains intact.  That is, we will continue to pay the Commission, not Edison, for T&D charges during the ""time out"" on our complaints.Mike and Jeanne will make sure that this critical piece, i.e., that we continue to place payments in escrow, will remain intact as part of the ""time out.""  If it turns out there are any doubts about this aspect, we'll likely need regroup and reconsider our options.If anyone has any questions or concerns please speak up, and/or if folks would still like to have a very brief call to discuss, we can do that and ensure that Bob is kept in the loop and can weigh in when he returns.Comments/thoughts?Best,Jeff.Bob's secretary called to tell me that Bob's at a doctor's appt and will be back in the office around noon Houston time.

The company told the CPUC thatSouthern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risenby $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular thewithholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between thesupply basins and the California border.""[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differentialhas been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse,collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers andmerchants,"" Edison told the CPUC.The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERCregarding this issue and is seeking a recision of ""certain allegedlycollusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gassuppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gasprices by wrongfully withholding capacity."" It notes the complaint""conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basisdifferential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100million annually since the beginning of 1998.""Edison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of$4.5133/MMBtu, which was applied to SCE's August 2000 avoided cost posting,to calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for themonth of October and every month going forward. It estimated Septemberbidweek border prices would average $7/MMBtu. If such prices were used inEdison's September avoided costs posting, its Transition Formula payments tocertain independent power producers will be $29 million more than the monthprior, the company told the CPUC. ""No mechanism exists to recapture theincrease in such payments if it is later determined by this commission or inanother forum that the Topock border indices are unreliable at this time.""--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","Steven Harris/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Jeffery Fawcett/ET&S/Enron@ENRON,",30 AM,So Cal Edison Claims Withholding of Pipeline Capacity,True

"John Sherriff has asked me to update you on the status of our relationshipwith EnCom, as well as what I am doing to develop a plan for the way forwardwith our investment.BackgroundAs you may be aware, Enron made its investment in EnCom in October 1999.Bruce Wrobel is President/CEO.  Our current cumulative investment is now$34,750,000.  We own 63.80 %, and have the right to put 5 members on a boardof nine.  There are two other strategic, Japanese investors in the business;Orix, primarily known as a leasing firm, and YTC, primarily a parts supplierfor Toyota.  Enron Japan (EJ) in particular values Orix as a strategicpartner even beyond the context of EnCom (a fact that was reconfirmed whenKen Lay met with their Chairman during his recent week in Tokyo).At present, the relationship between EnCom (its vehicle for doing business inJapan is E Power; and I will use the two terms interchangeably) and EJ is adifficult one.  EnCom entered the Japanese market some months before EJentered, and EnCom was seen in the market as Enron's entry vehicle forJapan.  I infer that EnCom has benefited from this association with the Enronname, and Enron apparently did not discourage it in the early days.  With thearrival of EJ in Tokyo early this year, Enron is working to roll out ourwholesale/merchant business model in Japan.  EnCom/E Power has and continuesto receive coverage in the media (much of it self-generated) indicating thatthey intend to sign up customers.  In fact, E Power's COO Mr. Awono, saysthat they will need to sign up retail customers to be able to have load tosupport the large power projects they are planning to do.  (This unlikelyformula suggests, at least on his part, a degree of naivete, at best, abouthow offtake from plants in deregulated markets can be and should bemanaged.).  Finally, EJ reports meeting with customers, e.g., Sony, whoindicate that E Power holds itself out as also being a ""trader"".  This hascaused some confusion in the marketplace about which ""Enron"" entity isproviding wholesale/merchant services.There now also is a question as to what EnCom's business model in Japanshould be.  Conversations between Orix and EJ personnel in Tokyo suggest thatOrix believed that Enron would be intimately involved in the day-to-daymanagement of EnCom (we are not, and Bruce has conceded that prior to EJ'sreporting relationship into London being established, Enron involvement anddirection was largely absent).  Moreover, it appears that Orix also believedthat EnCom would be engaged in the business of ""aggregation"" of powersupplies for further resale in the Japanese market (this is essentiallydescribing the core Enron merchant business in different terms).Conversations between Orix and EJ indicate that Orix now does not see EnComhaving in place the people and skills to execute on an aggregation businessstrategy.  Rather, Orix sees EnCom as having the skill sets of large-scaleasset developers, and this is not a business Orix is particularly interestedin pursuing.  Finally, Orix has an employee secunded to EnCom/E Power, and hereports that Orix now even lacks confidence in EnCom's ability to deliver anylarge-scale asset development opportunities.  John and I are tentativelyscheduled to meet Orix's Chairman in London on 27th November.To give E Power its due, it is now also frustrated (Wrobel telephoneconversation with me) because Ken Lay clearly signaled in some of his mediainterviews in Tokyo that we were bringing the full panoply of Enron skills tothe market, including the possibility of large-scale power projects.  It isWrobel's view that this message in the marketplace now undercuts EnCom, as hebelieves that people will look to a $60 billion market cap company as apreferred counterparty for asset development, over a company capitalised atpresent to the tune of about $40 million.  There is also a BusinessOpportunities Agreement between EnCom and EJ addressing how opportunitiesthat come to Enron personnel, who are also on EnCom's Board, should behandled.    Wrobel believes that we are being a bit narrow in ourinterpretation of the Business Opportunities Agreement, a view I do notshare. Ken's statements are correct, i.e., we can do large-scale developmentsin JapanIn sum, there is not an agreement as to a clear division of lines ofbusiness between the two organisations.At present, frustrations on both sides about confusion in the marketplace andin media messages (EnCom has now agreed that Enron will lead all contactswith the media, for both firms), have contributed to a situation that is notamicable.  Communications in Tokyo between EJ and E Power have virtuallydried up, though recently EJ has invited E Power to work together on aProposal for Mitsubishi.So Where Are We?John has asked me to lead an effort to evaluate Enron's investment in EnCom.This will be fairly comprehensive, including an assessment of the talent onthe ground in Tokyo, an assessment of the viability of their prospects (bothin terms of likelihood of permitting, and, to the extent possible, theireconomics), and an assessment of what Enron's stake in this venture ought tobe going forward.  I will evaluate the full range, from assuming 100%control, to a reduced stake (even down to zero), to taking equity inparticular projects.  As such, I have sent to Wrobel a list of itemsreflecting our initial information requirements for due diligence.Second, while this due diligence proceeds, we are also attempting to agree onrespective roles for EnCom and EJ in the Japanese market.  We remaincommitted to retaining an asset development capability in the market, whichdoes not go down well with Wrobel.  We also are sceptical that EnCom has onboard now, or will acquire, the risk management skills that we believe willbe necessary to actually manage fuel and offtake along the lines that Enronhas found highly profitable, e.g., Sutton Bridge tolling.  We have said thatwe respect their talent for being able to develop large-scale assets (thoughour Technical Services Group has already questioned their high staffinglevels), and that we feel the profit-maximising strategy for both firms isfor EnCom to develop projects (sites, permits, engineering), with Enronholding a tolling agreement and doing the project financing.  We believe EPower should be able to develop very bankable deals on this basis.  We do nothave agreement on this point.  Wrobel seemingly believes that they will beable to do the risk management functions, and receive lucrative returns forthe assets they do develop.  At this early stage we see no evidence that theycan manage such risks (or that lenders would let them do that), and that itis more likely that they will end up with a classic IPP structure with gas""in"", PPA ""out"", and reasonable but not rich returns on equity.  Wrobel seesour ""tolling agreement"" proposition as taking too much out of EnCom's deals.For our part, we have said we are willing to assure attractive equity returns(without saying what that number is), and reward them for their developmentefforts.Our latest effort is to try to agree a tolling arrangement for a project inTohoku province.  E Power has already met local officials.  As it turns out,EJ was approached by national government to do a project at the sameindustrial complex as that which E Power is working on.  By letter from me toWrobel of 15 November, Enron has proposed that we pool or combine our efforts(i.e., E Power's engineering and local permitting expertise, with Enron'spolitical capital garnered at national level), get the project done togetherrather than competing, and divide our labours as noted above, i.e., Enrondoes fuel and off-take, E Power does development of the asset.  In the phonecall from me to Wrobel that preceded the sending of the letter, Wrobelexpressed serious displeasure with Enron's proposal.  He and I are to speakagain; he is to call me back, and if he does not do so on 17 November, I willcall him on 20 November.I will plan to make progress on my wider review assuming cooperation fromEnCom on our due diligence information requirements.  John and I arecommitted to moving this forward quickly, but much of the necessaryinformation is not in hand.Please let me know if you have any further questions.","jeff.skilling@enron.com, mark.frevert@enron.com",mark.schroeder@enron.com,Status report on Enron's investment in EnCom,True

"richard.b.sanders@enron.comrichard.b.sanders@enron.comThanks for bringing me up to speed. My only comment on the letter is thatinstead of saying that we are not ""compelled"" to accept a litigationdiscount, it would be more direct to say that we see no reason to take alitigation discount and further discussions premised on the risk oflitigation will not be fruitful.I am not sure I fully understand some of the points in the presentationmaterials. If you want to discuss them, please call. (Although whether Iunderstand them may not be the point.)You may know this already, but Angela Davis in our legal group is nowhandling matters pertaining to Cornhusker instead of Dan Lyons.  She askedme to update you on where we are and send along two documents that needyour review prior to them being sent to Brazos.As you know, Chuck Ward and I have met w/Brazos on three occasions (twicein Waco in once by phone) since your meeting with them in Dallas onDecember 21.  The purpose of those meetings was to further reinforce thepoint made by you and Carl Tricoli that, as equity sellers, PPE/ENA valuesthe Cleburne asset based on its future cash flow with no discount for risksassociated with litigation.It became apparent to us during our meeting on March 16 that Brazos mayhave problems funding an acquisition at any price.  Specifically, Brazosis considering a number of capital projects aimed at securing long-termpower commitments to fill short positions associated with the Southernarrangement rolling off in 2003.  Based on their experience w/theCleburne, TX facility, Brazos appears to be committed to controllingtheir own destiny, and might find it much easier to fund marginalprojects with an all-in cost (or collateral value) that is closer tomarket.Primarily as a result of point 1, Brazos has asked us to look at thepossibility of PPA restructuring vs. acquisition.Also in conjunction with point 1, Brazos has been working with a numberof potential energy suppliers to secure long-term power commitments.  Itappears to us that they are preparing to sign some form of commitmentnext week.Clifton Karnei sent a letter to Chuck Ward and Steve Tick on March 29outlining expectations for a conference call that took place yesterday.The letter, which was actually received after the conference call, willbe faxed to you this afternoon.  Attached is a draft response along witha presentation that outlines the manner in which the partnership couldrestructure the PPA.  Steve, while he has not seen the letter, is of theopinion that it's Brazos' turn to speak; we may not need the letter, butit reinforces a number of points and sets up a restructuring in such away that we might like to send it along.We are giving a great deal of thought to the notion that a third partymight be willing (and able) to pay considerably more for this asset thanBrazos given its PPA, gas market conditions, and dispatch profile.Southern (having realized the PPA has embedded in it anin-the-money call option on gas) has recently begun to ""reversetoll"" the plant by turning it back during off-peak hours when thenet cost of replacement energy (i.e., the absolute price of marketpower less penalties paid under the PPA for heat rate degradationon energy taken from the plant plus gas market value) warrantseconomic dispatch.This asset commands a control premium from anyone that might beengaged (or about to engage) in a long-term, full requirementscontract with Brazos.There are tax benefits associated with this asset that could beeffectively monetized in a transfer of interests.Obviously, we would face the same obstacles that Tenaska faced inselling the asset.Please give me a call when you get a chance.Regards,Rick HillRest Concept @ 3-Apr-01.ppt)",garrick.hill@enron.com,tmoore@llgm.com,Cornhusker,False

GOP rivalof governor requested the inquiry.WALTER HAMILTON JEFFERY L. RABIN; DARYL KELLEYTIMES STAFF WRITERS07/31/2001Los Angeles TimesHome EditionB-1Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror CompanyThe Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiryinto whether energy consultants advising Gov. Gray Davis used insideinformation to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the state,a source with knowledge of the matter said Monday.The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, inresponse to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones. ARepublican rival of Davis, Jones charged that stock trading by consultantsmay have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based oninformation not available to the public.On Friday, top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had beenfired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions andtheir personal finances.As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the capital Monday, Davis officialswere confronted by a flurry of questions about who in the administration ownsenergy stocks.Financial disclosure records filed by the governor's spokesman, SteveMaviglio, show that he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas companyhe and his boss have accused of making ""obscene"" profits while California hasbeen ""on its knees."" Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houston-basedEnron Corp. in 1996.""It's not a crime to own energy stock,"" Maviglio said.He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which has thelargest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts.Maviglio placed the order for the stock on May 31, one day after San Jose'smayor dropped his opposition to a controversial Calpine plant favored by thegovernor and others. Under the terms of Maviglio's purchase, the transactionwas completed about three weeks later when the stock reached $40 a share, avalue of $12,000. It has since fallen in value.""I viewed it as a good long-term investment,"" Maviglio said, adding that hepurchased the shares for his retirement account based on publicly availableinformation.The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticismsthat it has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. ButCalifornia's grid operator has identified the company as one of many energymerchants to overcharge the state millions of dollars.The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value fromseveral thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show.Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs secretary BarryGoode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that he recently heldbetween $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state company accused ofmultimillion-dollar price gouging.In a statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month afterhe began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares weresupposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll, but his brokerfailed to do so.In light of the recent disclosures, Secretary of State Jones said thegovernor must do more to ensure the public that its interest comes first.""The governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updatedconflict of interest statements that reflect current holdings and anyactivity since their last statement of economic interest was filed,"" saidJones, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor.Word of the SEC's entry into California's energy problems comes as thegovernor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for the quick andbroad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him through thecrisis.In his written request to the SEC, Jones said that recently filed disclosuredocuments showed that at least one consultant bought and sold shares of twoenergy companies within the same month, raising ""a red flag"" about thepossibility of insider trading.State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving theirpersonal financial interests.The five consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter,delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was notclear which individuals are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether theagency's review would result in any charges.Two of the former traders said Monday that they had not been contacted byfederal investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insidertrading.But William Mead, fired Thursday, said it is no mystery why so many of hiscolleagues owned Calpine stock.Mead said he bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommendedit to his colleagues last year, while they all still worked for thenow-defunct California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was nottraded on that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said.Mead and three other energy traders--hired by the state in February andMarch--were terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying powerfor the state from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired tradersHerman Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date oftheir Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to befiled only two weeks ago.""But I'm sure they bought it while they were still at the power exchange,because that's when we discussed it,"" Mead said. ""It was kind of like ahobby. I'm sure it wasn't done with the intent to manipulate.""Former trader Elaine Griffin, who also owned Calpine stock and resigned twoweeks ago to take another job, said she didn't know she owned energysecurities until she checked with her financial advisor July 13, just beforeleaving her state job.Griffin said she and her husband own about $10,000 worth of Calpine stock inindividual retirement accounts managed by their advisor, who bought the stockFeb. 1 without their knowledge, she said, after research found it to be agood investment.""I kind of feel like we've been used for political reasons,"" Griffin said.""We would have disclosed anything right at first, but they never asked.""As a trader, Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for thestate, but only at market prices.Meanwhile, two Democratic political consultants, who helped Davis polish hisimage after the ongoing energy crisis caused his poll numbers to plummet,have agreed to accept no payment for their work as part of an out-of-courtsettlement of a taxpayer lawsuit.Tom Hiltachk, a lawyer for conservative anti-tax activist Lewis Uhler, saidthe settlement was reached last Friday after negotiations with lawyers forcommunications consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane.""Now they will not receive one red cent,"" said Hiltachk. ""Very simply Mr.Fabiani and Mr. Lehane have agreed to cease all activities for the governor,to accept no payments for their services and to basically get out of theconsulting business with the governor.""As his part of the agreement, Hiltachk said, Uhler withdrew his lawsuitMonday morning.Uhler had filed a lawsuit against the two consultants and Controller KathleenConnell in June contending that they should not receive any payments becauseof a conflict of interest. The two men also did consulting work forfinancially troubled Southern California Edison, which was seeking help fromDavis and the Legislature.Connell, a former Los Angeles mayoral candidate who has been at odds withDavis since he endorsed an opponent, had held up the payments pending theoutcome of the lawsuit.Under an agreement with Davis, the men were to have been paid $30,000 a monthfor six months.Fabiani and Lehane could not be reached for comment.*Times staff writers Nancy Vogel and Virginia Ellis in Sacramento and RobertJ.

He said he would sell the stock if Davis or administration lawyersasked him to.""I invested in a growing California company,"" Maviglio said. ""It's sad whensomebody tries to link owning energy stock with a conflict of interest.""The revelation came the same day that two high-priced consultants Davisbrought in earlier this year to help sell his energy policies to the publicagreed not to take any money for the work they have done. Davis wascriticized for hiring the two, partly because they had also worked asconsultants for Southern California Edison.On Friday, Davis fired five energy advisers for possible conflict-of-interest problems after they helped negotiate state spot-market purchasesor long-term power contracts. Four of the five owned stock in Calpine, andthe fifth held Enron shares.ON THE DEFENSIVEMaviglio, who had the task of explaining the firings, was on the defensivehimself yesterday.He bought the Calpine stock in June after asking his broker to invest in itwhen shares hit a certain price, he said. He said that showed he had made hisdecision independently of whatever action he might have taken in thegovernor's office on any particular day.Calpine's stock has dropped some in the past month. As of yesterday, the 300shares that Maviglio bought for $12,000 were worth about $11,100.Maviglio said he had spoken out against Calpine as much as other energycompanies. He also owns Enron stock that he bought in February 1996 and hasdisclosed on all forms, he added.""I've called them pirates and gougers and lumped them in with all the rest ofthe generators,"" Maviglio said.Secretary of State Bill Jones, an announced GOP opponent of Davis forgovernor in 2002, said Maviglio should be fired.""These actions are unethical and unacceptable,"" said Jones, who called on thegovernor's staff to release updated conflict-of- interest statements. ""He hadthe power to promote Calpine through press releases. That seems to me to be aclear conflict of interest.""Calpine sold the state $14 million worth of power earlier this year and has alarge share of the $43 billion in long-term contracts for electricity thatthe state has entered into.Earlier this month, when he threw the ceremonial switch on a new Calpineplant in Pittsburg, Davis singled out the company as being more cooperativewith California than out-of-state suppliers that the governor hascharacterized as gougers.IMAGE-POLISHINGThe Davis administration tried to put another energy-related controversybehind it yesterday as the two consultants brought in by the governor toburnish his image agreed to forgo more than $50,000 in work they did for thestate.Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani will receive no compensation and will leave theDavis administration immediately, under a settlement in a lawsuit filed onbehalf of a national taxpayer rights group.Lehane and Fabiani -- nicknamed the ""Masters of Disaster"" for their work ingetting former President Bill Clinton out of political jams -- started in thegovernor's office in May and were originally supposed to be paid $30,000 amonth.It was later revealed that they had also worked as consultants for SouthernCalifornia Edison, which is trying to swing a deal with the state to avoidbankruptcy. State Controller Kathleen Connell said she would not pay the two.""It really raises the question in my mind, what is it aboutconflict-of-interest and other ethical rules that the governor's officedoesn't understand?"" said Lewis Uhler, president of the National TaxLimitation Committee, which filed the lawsuit.In June, Davis said Fabiani was no longer a communications consultant becausehis work had been ""successfully implemented."" Lehane, on the other hand,dropped his contract with Edison and signed a new agreement with Davis.Lehane's new contract required him to work a maximum of 66 hours a month at$150 an hour. His payments were to be capped at $76,000 for work from June 26to Nov. 20, 2001.'OUTRAGEOUS EXPENSE'""This was an outrageous expense to taxpayers,"" Uhler said. ""I believe therewas a clear violation of conflict-of-interest laws.""The consultants decided it was not worth the legal fees to fight the lawsuit,Maviglio said. The two could not be reached for comment.""It's shameful when people have to surrender their jobs in public servicebecause of a lawsuit,"" Maviglio said.Jones, who filed a complaint with the Fair Political Practices Commissionconcerning the two consultants, said, ""I think it's clear from recent actionsby the governor's office that there have been rampant violations of thestate's conflict-of-interest laws. Their attempts to mitigate the damage fromthese violations is too little, too late.""Jones said Davis should immediately require all of the consultants hiredduring the energy crisis to file financial statements. There are 21 advisersinvolved in power purchasing whom Davis has exempted, he said.All the contractors who are required to file reports have done so, saidMaviglio.In a related development, the Los Angeles Times quoted a source as saying theSecurities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry intowhether energy consultants advising Davis used inside information to tradestocks of power companies doing business with the state.The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, inresponse to a request from Jones.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Gov. Gray Davis' press secretary recently purchasedthe same energy stock as five consultants the governor fired last week, hedisclosed Monday.Steve Maviglio confirmed that on June 20, he bought 300 shares of stock inCalpine Corp., a San Jose-based power generator that has received about $13billion in state contracts to supply electricity for up to 20 years.Maviglio's disclosure comes after Davis' office hastily ended the contractsof five consultants who helped negotiate state power contracts and held stockin energy companies.In a related development, an anonymous source told the Los Angeles Times onMonday that the Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminaryinquiry into whether the consultants used inside information to trade theenergy stocks.About two dozen Davis energy consultants were required to fill out financialdisclosure statements after complaints of conflict of interest by Republicansand consumer groups.""When we reviewed them, we found possible violations of the law and tookswift action,"" Maviglio said Monday before Secretary of State Bill Jonesissued a press release calling for his termination.Jones, a Republican, is a candidate for the GOP nomination to challenge Davisin November 2002.Maviglio defended his purchase, saying that he ""owns several stocks incompanies in all fields that are growing and are based in California.""Maviglio said Monday that he requested on May 31 to purchase the stock if itdipped to $40 a share, which it did two days after a June 18 ruling byfederal energy regulators restricting wholesale electricity prices inCalifornia and 10 other states.Maviglio served as Davis' chief spokesman urging the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission to impose price ceilings on electricity wholesalers.He also said he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 stock in Houston-basedEnron Corp. He said he purchased the stock in 1997 and has reported it onfinancial disclosure forms. He said that it is ""closer to $10,000.""Meanwhile, two energy consultants to Davis have agreed to forgo more than$50,000 in work they did for the state.Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani will forgo the payments as part of a settlementwith a Sacramento-area resident who filed a lawsuit objecting to theirhiring, calling it a conflict of interest.Fabiani could not be reached for comment Monday. In the settlement, theyadmitted no wrongdoing.Lehane issued a statement through the governor's office, calling it ""simplynot worth the bother to challenge the controller in court.""Davis has come under fire for his May hiring of Lehane, former presssecretary for Vice President Al Gore, and Fabiani, a deputy campaign managerfor Gore's presidential run.They were hired to help shape Davis' response to the energy crisis, andhelped craft Davis' aggressive attack on Texas-based energy companies andPresident Bush.Both also have advised Southern California Edison, which is negotiating forstate help in avoiding bankruptcy. Financial disclosure forms showed theyhave each received at least $10,000 from Edison in the past year.Davis announced at the end of June that Fabiani terminated his contract, andDavis scaled back Lehane's role with the state.State Controller Kathleen Connell then said she would not pay Lehane andFabiani for any of their work and now the two have agreed they will not fighther decision, Maviglio said.Lewis K. Uhler, the Placer County man who filed the lawsuit, said thesettlement ""accomplished our objectives.""""We wanted to block the egregious use of taxpayer funds for essentiallypolitical spinmeisters,"" he said. Uhler is president of the Roseville-basedNational Tax Limitation Committee.Maviglio said that Fabiani and Lehane ""did good work for the state"" andhelped the state win victories with federal regulators.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.NEW DELHI, India (AP) - The federal government has told financialinstitutions to pump in more money or find a new investor to save the Dabholpower project, now that U.S.-based Enron Corp. has said it wants out, TheFinancial Express reported Tuesday.The Industrial Development Bank of India, and other institutions, have beentold to work out a package to complete the dlrs 2.9 billion project inwestern Maharashtra state, the paper said, quoting unidentified officials ofthe banks and the Power Ministry.Power Ministry officials were quoted as saying that Enron had agreed inprinciple to finish the project if the dlrs 230 million can be found, andthen Enron could sell its majority stake.The project was billed as the world's largest natural gas-fired power plant,able to generate 2,184 megawatts once completed at Dabhol, 335 kilometers(210 miles) south of Bombay. The second phase, to be run on liquefied naturalgas, was to be commissioned by the end of the year.Enron, based in Houston, Texas has invested dlrs 875 million in the project -India's biggest foreign investment. Enron said July 28 it wants the Indiangovernment and lenders to buy out its 65 per cent stake.The plant stopped production in May after its only customer, the MaharashtraState Electricity Board, said it was canceling a seven-year-old powerpurchase agreement. The state also stopped buying power from Enron'stwo-year-old naphtha plant.The state says Enron's prices are too high and has demanded the contract berenegotiated.The Financial Express said that lenders are ready to pump another dlrs 320million into Dabhol, but there is a shortfall of an additional dlrs 230million.The financial institutions will have to find a new investor or provide themoney themselves, the newspaper quoted its sources as saying.It also quoted Power Ministry officials as saying it would be difficult tofind a buyer until the project is completed. Some of the needed money may besought from Maharashtra state, which had committed to making payments, thepaper quoted Power Ministry officials as saying.The current charges for power are still a matter of contention, however.The paper said Enron had reduced its price demands, after the governmentoffered various tax and customs duty concessions, but the government wantsthe price for electricity to be cut further.(lak)Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

This comes barely weeks after the visit ofEnrons chairman Kenneth Lay who had then maintained that the 'company iscommitted to India' and is looking forward to 'positive talks'.The package which will be submitted to a high level committee, which isrepresented by the finance, power and law ministry and headed by unionfinance secretary Ajit Kumar. Representatives of the Union power and financeministry met last week to thrash out the main objectives of the package.According to FI sources, the package which is expected to be finalisedshortly will have to have a twin objective of completing the project andfinding takers for the power to be generated.The phase II of the project (phase I of which is already operational)requires an additional investment of $550 million to be completed of which$320 million has already been tied up with the lenders.Another $230 million has to be pumped in into the project. Given the factthat Enron is unwilling to pump in any more funds in the project, the FIswill have to look for the additional resources.The required resources can be moped up only through the infusion of freshinvestments by a new developer or if the FIs are willing to put in the moneythemselves.FIs are also holding discussions with MSEB to honour their obligation and payup the fixed charges of about Rs 95 crore which could then be used forcompleting the project.Sources said although Enron has decided to call it a day in the Indian powersector, the company is not averse to the proposal of completing this projectwithout any further investments. Experts are of the view that this would makesense even for Enron who could then expect a better price for its equity.On the sale of power and restructuring of tariff, the FIs are holdingnegotiations with DPC and the various agencies who play a role incontributing to the tariff. While DPC has offered a tariff of Rs 3.59 perunit, the FIs will try and work towards a tariff close to Rs 2.80 per unit.Apart from aspects like working a separate arrangement for the LNG plant,reduction in Customs duty and sales tax on LNG, attempts would be made toalso try and reduce LNG prices by asking the suppliers to rework their rates.Official sources indicated that Enrons decision to finally announce itsintention to exit from the Dabhol project is likely to lead to some decisionthis way or the other.The Centre which has till now played a passive role and has left the issue tobe resolved bilaterally is now playing a more proactive role and willdefinitely take every step to avoid litigations at the international lenderslevel.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Tuesday. It will then start flooding theInternet with traffic as it tries to replicate itself, creating theequivalent of an overwhelming number of surfers hitting the Web at once.Dave Power, senior vice president of technology at Reliant Communications,said nearly every Internet service provider is taking the threat seriouslyand will monitor it carefully as it develops.""At the end of our staff meeting today the message we all left with was, `Beprepared for the siege,'"" Power said.Unlike a virus, which spreads when a user opens an e-mail attachment, CodeRed is a self-propagating worm that spreads itself without humanintervention.When Code Red first showed up earlier this month it infected more than250,000 systems in just nine hours, security officials say. It tried to shutdown the White House's Web server by sending a flood of data requests itsway, but officials changed the Internet Protocol address, the numericreference to a computer's location on the Internet, of the White House sitebefore the attack began.When the worm reactivates Tuesday tonight it could begin spreading morequickly, bringing sporadic but widespread Internet slowdowns and defacing Webpages.The potential threat to Internet service is so severe that several federalagencies and companies, including the FBI and Microsoft, held a joint pressconference Monday.""The Internet has become indispensable to our national security and economicwell-being,"" said Ron Dick, head of the National Infrastructure ProtectionCenter, an arm of the FBI. ""Worms like Code Red pose a distinct threat to theInternet.""Code Red scans the Internet for Web servers, sending a string of code tothose machines that takes up residence not in the hard drive but in thebuffer memory where it is difficult to detect. The worm targets serversrunning Microsoft Windows NT and Windows 2000 with Internet InformationServer, or IIS, software versions 4.0 and 5.0.The worm isn't likely to infect the computers most people have at home or ontheir desktops at work, but rather will infect Web servers, the powerfulmachines kept in air-conditioned data centers that let people view Web sitesonline. That means any sort of Web surfing, from checking e-mail to buyingbooks online to looking up stock quotes, may be anywhere from significantlyslow to nearly impossible.""So the ordinary person using a cable modem or DSL won't be infected, andthey don't need to worry about their privacy or confidentiality,"" said ChrisPick, vice president of product strategy for Houston-based PentaSafe SecurityTechnologies. ""But they will notice that some of the Web sites they want tohit are either running slowly or are simply not available.""Unlike an e-mail virus, which spreads when a user opens an e-mail attachment,Code Red is a self-propagating worm that spreads itself without humanintervention.Code Red scans the Internet for Web servers, sending a string of code tothose machines that takes up residence not in the hard drive, but in thebuffer memory where it is difficult to detect. The worm targets serversrunning Microsoft's Internet Information Server, or IIS, software versions4.0 and 5.0.From within a server Code Red begins scanning a randomly generated list ofInternet addresses to find another server to infect. If the infected server'sdefault language is English, all Web pages served by that machine will beChinese!""Officials say they have not identified the author of the program, but itsname is said to be a reference to a soda made by Mountain Dew that is popularwith hackers, and the name is not a reference to ""Red"" China.Officials say they have not identified the author of the virus, but its nameis said to be a reference to a popular soda made by Mountain Dew with hackersand not China.The real problems created by Code Red are not related to security or privacyissues, or even the Web page graffiti, but rather the amount of traffic thatwill be generated by hundreds of thousands of Web servers sending out datapackets searching for other machines to infect.The first 19 days of a month the worm is set up to scan and infect, but fromday 20 until day 27 the worm floods a certain Internet address -- in thiscase the White House Web server -- with information requests causing adenial-of-service attack.The White House changed its Internet address prior to the attack earlier thismonth and avoided being knocked out, but that didn't kill off Code Red. Theworm has been sitting dormant on servers for the past two weeks, but when thedate changes from 31st to the 1st, it will begin scanning for new hosts toinfect again.A software patch to fix the Microsoft IIS program's vulnerability has beenavailable since June, a few weeks after developers and security experts foundthe problem. Unfortunately, not enough system administrators and Web mastersinstalled it before the outbreak.""Hacker groups in general are aware of these vulnerabilities, but they can betaken care of relatively easily with just a little vigilance,"" Pick said.Jeremy Hewlett, security administrator for Reliant Communications, saiddownloading the software patch should be the first priority for any systemadministrator. In addition to the Microsoft site, the National InfrastructureProtection Center, www.nipc.gov, and Symantec Co., www.symantec.com cq forboth addresseshave information about detecting and removing the worm.Observers say Microsoft products are common targets for virus writers becausethe software is found running on so many sites and because Microsoft has notalways been as attentive to security issues as it could be.""With Windows NT and Windows 2000 they were engineered to work in tandem witha lot of other systems at once, so security was not engineered into theproducts from the start,"" Pick said. ""They haven't focused on it much in thepast but are starting to become more aware of it.""Microsoft is known for not testing its products as well as it could either,Power said, which also leads to many post-release patches and updates.""They're not very forthcoming with problems, which is why you'll see mostpeople go to the public and press with issues first,"" Power said.Microsoft took part in the public warnings about Code Red on Monday and hasbeen providing the patch for free on its Web site for weeks.Hewlett said the staff at Reliant Communications has already cleared itsnetwork of the worm but is expecting to work late Tuesday night monitoringincoming attacks from other infected servers. University networks are amongsome of the likely breeding grounds since schools' Information Technologydepartments tend to be particularly short-staffed in the summers.""We saw enormous volumes of traffic from the schools last time, but nobodyreally monitors the university networks for this,"" he said.While the denial-of-service attack aimed at the White House could have beendamaging if it had not been redirected in time, there's nothing stopping avirus writer from setting his or her sights on another target, like acompany's Web site.""It could be Enron's site, it could be any other government site, or any partof the net's infrastructure that's vital to the economy,"" Pick said.

Gray Davis purchased shares ofCalpine Corp (CPN) on June 20, 2001, he said Monday, but declined to say howmany shares he purchased.This is the first time an official in Davis' office has admitted topurchasing shares in energy companies since the state took on the job ofbuying power in January in lieu of the utilities.As reported, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has beeninvestigating Davis administration officials for more than a month to see ifthey purchased stock in energy companies using information that wasunavailable to the public. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said, however, thathis stock holdings didnot represent a conflict of interest. Maviglio has not been named in theSEC investigation, and says he made his purchases based on publicinformation.""There's no crime in owning energy company stocks,"" Maviglio said. ""Mypurchase of Calpine was based on information I read in the newspapers.""Maviglio also owns between $10,001-$100,000 in Enron Corp (ENE) stock,according to a 2000/2001 financial disclosure form. He said he has ownedEnron stock since 1996.Last week, five state energy consultants were fired by Davis' staff forconflicts of interest because they helped California buy power from Calpine,a company in which they owned stock, state officials said.The consultants, who were hired by the state in January, did not fileeconomic interest statements until July, when Secretary of State Bill Jonesrevealed that the consultants and energy traders held stocks in energycompanies they were buying from. Jones said Monday that Maviglio's actionswere ""unethical, unconscionable and unacceptable.""""The Governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updatedconflict of interest statements to reflect current holdings and any activitysince their last Statement of Economic Interests was filed,"" Jones said in astatement. Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Democrat Davis nextyear for governor and who has been highly critical of Davis' handling of theenergy crisis, also called for an expansion of investigations.""The SEC, the Attorney General and the Fair Political Practices Commissionmust now expand their investigations to include all of the Governor's staffin addition to the consultants who are already under investigation,"" thestatement said.Attorney General Bill Lockyer has not yet decided whether he will launch aninvestigation into the Davis administration, a Lockyer spokeswoman said.The governor's own investments are in a blind trust, meaning a trusteehandles Davis' financial affairs and the governor has no knowledge of theinvestments.""I have always owned mutual funds and have never bought stock in individualcompanies. That has been my policy since the beginning of my administration,""Davis said Monday at a bill-signing event in Los Angeles.State conflict-of-interest laws say that public officials cannot negotiatecontracts for companies in which they hold stock, and officials cannot usetheir positions to influence the state's decisions with respect to thosecompanies.The conflict-of-interest laws apply to all state bodies, including theCalifornia Public Utilities Commission and the California Independent SystemOperator, which runs the state's real-time energy market.The five members of the ISO Board of Governors listed no holdings in energycompanies since Jan. 24 on their most recent disclosure forms, signed betweenJan. 24-July 24. The board was appointed by Davis in January. Disclosureforms for the CPUC and employees with the California Department of WaterResources, the state's power-buying arm, could not be immediately obtained.SEC investigators said Sunday that a preliminary investigation has revealedthat several employees and consultants working directly with Davis on energyissues have purchased ""significant"" shares of Calpine stock between Januaryand July. Individuals purchased stocks in other energy companies, butinvested heavily in Calpine, the investigators said. Nearly half of thestate's $43 billion in long-term energy pacts will come from Calpine,according to details of contracts released last month. Some of the contractswere signed as early as February, but Davis had refused to release thedetails of the supply until a Superior Court Judge ordered the administrationto do so in mid-June after news organizations filed a lawsuit.Davis has accused power suppliers of price gouging, and his attorney generalhopes to send power company executives to jail. But Davis has spared Calpinethe invective, touting the San Jose-based generator as a ""California company""helping to keep the lights on in the state.Maviglio has said the governor has praised Calpine because its prices arewell below those charged by other generators and because the company hasinvested in California for the long haul.Calpine is ""not attempting to suck every dime out of the state and throwparties in Houston,"" he said.-By Jessica Berthold and Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires;323-658-3872/3874; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com, jason.leopold@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

It is too premature to say anything rightnow,"" a senior federal power ministry official, who did not want to beidentified, told Reuters.He said the federal government had not received any formal offer from Enronto sell its equity in the controversial project.Government sources said that ministry officials were talking to Indianfinancial institutions to assess Enron's statement.A power ministry official said if the federal government picked up Enron'sequity in the project, it could save the government millions of dollars inpenalties which it would have to pay if it lost an arbitration case over theproject.Apart from Enron, DPC's shareholders include U.S. group General Electric andBechtel, which own 10 percent each, and a local utility, the MaharashtraState Electricity Board (MSEB), which holds 15 percent.Enron has been locked in a bitter payment dispute with MSEB, which had signeda contract to buy all the power produced by Dabhol, whose first phase of 740MW was completed last year, and the second phase of 1,444 MW is nearlycomplete.A BLESSINGIndia's western state of Maharashtra, where the project is located, welcomedEnron's offer to sell its equity in the controversial project, the PressTrust of India reported.""It will be God's biggest blessing for us,"" the agency quoted the state'sEnergy Minister Padamsinh Patil as saying in Bombay.It also quoted the head of a negotiating committee, M. Godbole as saying thatthe panel's next meeting, scheduled after a month, would be cancelled in viewof Enron's statement that it wants to exit Dabhol.MSEB and Enron's dispute escalated in April, when the U.S. firm notified thegovernment it was applying to an arbitration court in London to consider itsclaim for 1.02 billion rupees owed by MSEB for power it purchased in Decemberfrom DPC.The company also sent a political force majeure notice to MSEB. Such a noticeis a contractual clause dissatisfied parties give as a first step towardspossibly dissolving a contract.In May, the defaulting utility stopped buying power from Dabhol, saying itwas expensive.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.California Governor's Spokesman Says He Bought Calpine StockCalifornia Governor's Spokesman Says He Bought Calpine StockSacramento, California, July 30 (Bloomberg) -- A spokesmanfor California Governor Gray Davis said bought $12,000 worth ofstock in energy producer Calpine Corp. in June as the state wasworking with the company to open new power plants and buyingmillions of dollars a day in electricity.Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio purchased 300 shares ofCalpine on June 20 after putting in an order on May 31 to buy thestock when it fell to $40, he said. The purchase is being reviewedby the Governor's legal office, Maviglio said.``These purchases were based on no knowledge of anything,just public information about a growing California company,''Maviglio said. ``I've informed the governor, the chief of staffand our legal counsel today. I'd be glad to divest myself ifthat's what required.''Maviglio also said he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 inEnron Corp. shares, which he said he purchased in 1996. Hispurchases came to light three days after California officials saidthey fired five consultants hired to advise California on energyafter they disclosed that they owned shares of Calpine.The consultants worked for the Department of Water Resources,which at the time was buying millions in electricity from Calpineand other energy generators. California has spent almost $8billion buying electricity for its two largest utilities, whichhave been insolvent since January.Nine energy consultants were ordered by Davis's lawyer BarryGoode last week to sell any energy-company stock they owned,including shares of Enron Corp., Calpine Corp., and Dynegy Inc.,after Secretary of State Bill Jones pressured Davis to releasedetails of their holdings.Jones said today in a statement that Maviglio should be firedfor the purchases.``These actions are unethical, unconscionable, unacceptableand heads should role,'' Jones said. ``Mr. Maviglio should befired immediately.''Jones has publicly called on Davis to force the 50consultants hired by the state to disclose their holdings inenergy companies. Last week he urged the Securities and ExchangeCommission to investigate whether any of the consultants oradvisers traded stock based on non-public information.Maviglio said no one in the administration or at theDepartment of Water Resources had been contacted by the SEC. ``Noone's been contacted either here or at DWR,'' Maviglio said.A spokeswoman for the SEC in San Francisco, Helane Morrison,said the agency would not confirm or deny an investigation.Calpine shares are down 6.8 percent since June 20, whenMaviglio says he purchased the shares.",,ann.schmidt@enron.com,Enron Mentions,True

"hi stevecould you let christian know about the secretarty situation - I tried to cc him  on the earlier message  sent you but I just got a response saying no delivery.  thanks.Elizabeth,I am also going to fax to you two pages showing our credit exposure to SPP and NP.  Worst case, back of the envelope, we are looking at approximately $400 million in MTM exposure for all deals.  However, the prices under these deals range from $27.50/MWh to $311/MWh (the $3.60 deal is for transmission).  It's extremely unlikely that FERC would (1) void every transaction or (2) reduce the price for every deal to $0.  Therefore, the true amount at risk is less than $400 million.1.  The ALJ in the Pacific Northwest refund case rejected claims for refunds of bilateral transactions because (1) the non-California long-term market was competitive, and (2) because of the concern about ""ripple"" claims.  Although the Commission has not yet adopted the ALJ's recommendation, I expect they will because it's the path of least resistance and has popular support.2.  SPP/NP is the only party arguing that the Southwest market is uncompetitive.  This aspect was fatal to the Pacific Northwest claims because the majority of the market did not want refunds.3.  SPP/NP was not required to buy power under these contracts----unlike the California utilities, which were required to buy from the PX.  Presumably, these were the lowest prices available at the time.4.  If FERC voids or reprices these contracts, it will be pressured to do the same for California's DWR contracts.Steve<<sierra2 101901.xls>>","Sager, Elizabeth","Hall, Steve C.

Suggestedamendments included extending the term of members beyond one year,increasing the number of members beyond 3, whether there should besenate confirmation of ISO and PX board members, or at least votingrepresentation for the legislature on the Energy Oversight Board whichwill approve the ISO/PX members.  There was also discussion of whetherFERC would approve of this new governance structure.   Anotherdiscussion centered on whether the positions should be full time, asopposed to part time, and how to define =01&affiliated=018 in conjunction w=iththe bill=01,s ban on members of the ISO and PX being affiliated with amarket participant.administration, CalPIRG, PX, TURN, UCAN, ORA, Coalition of UtilityEmployees.FERC orders and concern that the bill would lead to lengthy litigation.They suggested that if the ISO and PX boards were appointed solely bythe California governor that FERC would not find that legally sufficientto be =01&independent=018.ABX1-6 Dutra/Pescetti  addressed retained utility generation assets andcommission regulation of same.  The bill as written is merely a clean upto clarify that the CPUC would retain jurisdiction over utilitygeneration after it is valued for purposes of calculating CTC=01*until andunless the CPUC gives permission for the plant to be sold under Section851.    The discussion evolved into a lengthy inquiry over the differentregulatory schemes for utility and non-utility generation.  AssemblymanLeonard questioned whether it was efficient to have a market where aportion of the generation was regulated and another portionunregulated.  More and more members skirted the subject of attempting toregulate the non-utility generators within the state.  In supportingtestimony, CPUC President Lynch essentially asked for jurisdiction oversuch generators, stating that CPUC inspectors were denied access to anAES plant at Redondo Beach for 9 hours during an ISO alert yesterday.Chmn. Wright asked Lynch to assemble a list of the regulatory powers shewould seek.PG&E agreed with Lynch and also argued that the Legislature shouldrevisit the exemption regulation for marketers and non-utilitygenerators contained in Code section 216(I).   PG& also had suggestedtechnical amendments, which were not released, which dealt withconfirming that Section 367 still requires market valuation and that theCPUC can set the ratemaking for such retained assets.We have talked with the author about meeting with him after theamendments are available.  No amendments were voted on for any of thesebills until they are brought up in the Senate.  Thus there was onlylimited discussion of amendments.","alan.comnes@enron.com, angela.schwarz@enron.com, beverly.aden@enron.com,",Sandi McCubbin,Extraordinary Session - Update,False

"Gerald - Per Steve's request, it is not Burlington but Mariner that is theinterested party.  His name is Greg Harless and his e-mail isgharless@mariner-energy.com.  Ted  P.S. The lawyer at Burlington is JimVianna.Bland/HOU/ECT@ECTAttached is Marathon's response to our email.  I will call Brad to set up atelephone conference.Ted,  Steve asked that I forward this information to a lawyer at Burlington,but couldn't recall the name.  Do you have any contact information forBurlington.  Thanks.""Bradley G Penn"" <bgpenn@marathonoil.com>Gerald, It seems that the drafts that have been sent back to Marathon haveconfused the relationships of Marathon, Mariner and MEGS. As an example youhave requested that the LOPSA rely on the O&M Agreement between Mariner andMEGS, which Marathon is not a party.  We would rather that agreement remainbetween MEGS and Mariner and be the basis for your resolution of disputes.The legal capacities presented in your response to the LOPSA draft areconfusing. All rights seem to flow to MEGS, yet the obligations seem to be onMariner, we do not believe the division of rights and obligations in thismanner are a good situation. By example the Indemnity provisions have beenaltered to have Mariner indemnify the Owners and Operator (no mention ofMEGS)and then further change the indemnity to a negligence based indemnity(of Platform Operator). The PHA is a unilateral indemnity to PlatformOperator and Platform Owners and we must insist on this same level ofprotection with MEGS.If you would like to make another attempt at either a ratification or LOPSAthat addresses MEGS as Lessee and Mariner as its operator and provide for anyresolution between those two in the O&M Agreement we would be happy todiscuss this further. If you would like to go through the LOPSA line by lineplease call and we can set up a teleconference with our legal department todo so.BGPI have reviewed your response and disagree with the characterization of ourmodification the documents. I would like to clarify our reasons for themodifications to avoid any further miscommunications.MEGS' alteration of the documents do not impair the protections afforded toMarathon under the Production Handling Agreement.  Our modifications weresimply intended to allocate certain risks between MEGS and Mariner withrespect to Marathon (as operator of the South Pass 89 B Platform) as suchrisks were intended to be allocated by MEGS and Mariner.  Mariner'stransfer of interest in the flowline to MEGS introduces a new party whichMarathon can look to for certain obligations with respect to the platform.The alterations do not remove Mariner from its current role as operator andmaintainer of the flowline and owner of the hydrocarbons.  For thesereasons, I would disagree with your response that the draft alterations donot provide the intended protections that Marathon would expect absent sucha transfer to MEGS.  Mariner still shoulders these risks and expenses underthe Production Handling Agreement.Having MEGS fully ratify the Production Handling Agreement  and becomingjointly and severally liable to Marathon is not appropriate.   MEGS doesnot hold title to any hydrocarbon production or operate the facilities andshould not be liable for all risks and expenses associated therewith.Mariner should continue to shoulder those risks and as before.I would be happy to discuss your issues with our Platform Lease revisionsat your convenience or to discuss the above further.""Bradley GERGetz@GROUPWISE.MarathonOil.com,onoil.com>            JCAlbert@GROUPWISE.MarathonOil.com05/26/2000Attached are our response and ratification agreement.BGPBrad,  Can you give me a status on where you are at with the review of theLeaseDocs for the MEGS Facilities?

"I think that this looks pretty good, and don't know if we could better thecost too much by looking around.  Cara, would you like for me to hold thereservation on my credit card?  Don't know how much baby stuff may be hittingyours, so I would be glad to do so.I am real comfortable with sharing the costs of this dinner, but don'tnecessarily feel that we have to split it in thirds.  This is a good year forme to cover a large portion of the cost - when we did the 40th anniversaryparty, David and I  were not in such good shape and I think that Cindy andRichard covered a lot of the costs.  Things ebb and flow - 2000 was a goodyear at Enron and this would be a good time for me to put some of my rewardto good use.  --SallyOk--being the one that probably doesn't really have the dollars to do this Iwould still say ""yes""----will try to make room on a credit card forthis--have until June so I think it is ok.....Will call the picture lady tomorrow and see what the price would be forthat--will email you the results.Sista Cindy.Hi, sistas-We can reserve with just a credit card; no deposit required.I confirmed ""17"" with mom.Heidi sent some sample menus.   A 3-course menu (appetizer or salad, entree,dessert) is $45.A 4-course (same as 3-course plus hors d'oeuvres) sample menu is $52.Each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course.

Should we explore other options - or just go withthis?   I think Chris and I would be fine with this sort of cost - butprobably couldn't go crazy with gift and decorations too.

"Richard -Excellent summary.  thanks.RH.Rogers,Enron Energy Services, Inc. (""EESI"") submitted application to become a NEPO=OL member, to be effective January 1, 2000.  EESI was approved by the NEPOO=L Participants Membership Subcommittee at its January 24, 2000 meeting.  On=e requirement of NEPOOL membership is to satisfy the Financial Assurance Po=licy for NEPOOL Members.  EESI, Enron Energy Marketing Corp, and Enron Powe=r Marketing, Inc. are all members of NEPOOL and have chosen to satisfy the =Financial Assurance Policy by issuance of Performance Bond(s), rather than =corporate guaranty, due to Enron's disagreement with the Form of Corporate =Guaranty required by NEPOOL.EESI, via Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, issued a Performance Bond in th=e amount of $8,000,000 in June 2000; the Performance Bond was reissued in J=une 2001 in the amount of $8,000,000.  EESI received a letter from ISO New =England dated October 10, 2001, addressed to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements)=and received by Becky probably October 12, 2001, indicating that EESI's cu=rrent Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase th=e amount to $11,703,018.75 to cover EESI's current activity level.  Becky d=elivered the October 10th letter  to my attention whereby I took the letter=to EESI Legal Department (Karen Cordova) and informed Karen that EESI need=ed to increase the Performance Bond to $20,000,000.  Karen requested Credit=Department (Nichole Gunter) initiate an increase in the Performance Bond t=o the $20,000,000 level; to the best of my knowledge the initial conversati=on with Credit Department was October 12, 2001.  In telephone conversations=with ISO-NE, Enron's Credit Department personnel were informed by ISO-NE t=hat in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default the matter needed to be r=esolved within ten (10) days of the date of the October 10, 2001 letter (Oc=tober 19, 2001), however the letter did not indicate such.=20I was notified by Credit Department on October 16, 2001 that the bond compa=ny Enron utilizes for performance bond(s) would not process our Performance=Bond request for increase until Enron paid the bond company for outstandin=g invoices for ""other"" performance bonds (bond  renewals), approximately $1=50,000.  The ""other"" performance bond invioces had been bounced around EESI=, since June 2001, to various individuals (i.e. Greg Sharp, Mark Mueller, J=eff Golden, Scott Mills) and had still remained unpaid.  Payments for the ""=other"" performance bonds were made and the bond company processed our reque=st for increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to $20,000,000, which w=as issued by the bond company on October 23, 2001, executed by EESI on Octo=ber 23, 2001 and forwarded via FAX and Overnight Mail to ISO-NE on October =23, 2001.  EESI was unable to comply with the October 19, 2001 deadline to =resolve the Financial Assurance Default due to complications with the bond =company as mentioned above.  Credit Department personnel informed ISO-NE pe=rsonnel that EESI would not meet the October 19, 2001 deadline, but was wor=king diligently to resolve the matter; Credit Department personnel sent via=FAX, a copy of the request to the bond company for revisions to the Perfor=mance Bond to ISO-NE personnel on October 19, 2001. =20I notified Dan Allegretti, (Enron Government Affairs & Chariman, NEPOOL Par=ticipants Committee) of the entire situation prior to October 19, 2001.  Da=n indicated that he did not think there would be any problems, but to get t=he matter resolved as quickly as possible. Dan advised me that the implicat=ions of the Financial Assurance Default would result in communications to t=he Membership Subcommittee and that when the next letter was published, the=following month, EESI would no longer be listed as being in default.  On O=ctober 19, 2001 another letter was sent to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements) f=rom Edward McKenna, Vice President & Chief Financial Officer informing EESI=that ""Enron Energy Services, Inc. has not maintained the required level of=financial assurance for 10 days or more, and has had a total combination o=f 3 financial assurance and/or payment defaults in the last 12 months, whic=h qualifies them as having 2 (two) Level 1 defaults.  The ISO has been in c=ontact with Enron Energy Services, Inc. through multiple telephone communic=ations, and to date the financial assuvance default has not been cured.  Th=erefore, per the established procedure, we are forwarding this information =to the NEPOOL Membership Subcommittee for action by them.""  According to Da=n Allegretti the Memberhsip Subcommittee reports to him, as Chariman of the=Members Subcommittee, and he would discuss the issue with them.  The previ=ous two Financial Assurance Defaults mentioned the October 19, 2001 letter =occurred (i) December 2000, when payment was received 1-2 days late and was=automatically resolved when payment was received and (ii) September 2001, =when Financial Assurance Default occurred and was resolved through market a=ctivity.  To the best of my knowledge, EESI was unaware of either the Decem=ber 2000 Payment Default or the September 2001 Financial Assurance Default,=and no information was received by EESI from ISO-NE relative to either inc=idence.According to (i) Protocal for the Initation of Membership Termination Proce=edings and (ii) conversations with Dan Allegretti, the issue should be reso=lved with the receipt on October 24, 2001 of the Performance Bond by ISO-NE=.  I have also advised the ISO-NE, in the future, to send communications to=EESI's Credit Department and not EESI's Settlements.  Also, Dan Allegretti=is investigating the facts leading the the October 19, 2001 letter with re=presentatives from ISO-NE.I left message for Molly Harris as you requested.

""Clearly, Enron proposes breaking the rules of h=ow=20media can be=20bought and sold.""Last year, Enron Corp., the $30 billion financial risk management company==20previously associated=20with the energy industry, created EMS to market ""price-risk management"" pla=ns=20to advertisers=20and media-service companies. In addition, Houston-based Enron seeks to=20execute $1 billion in media=20buys by year's end, though a representative declined to release information==20about any possible deals.In this volatile economy, marketers and media agencies could use Enron's=20ability to hedge the risk=20of media costs as far as five years ahead, said Edward Ondarza, a vp for EM=S.=20Up to this point, the only way marketers could cushion risk is by ""buying==20forward"" via the upfront,=20he added. ""We want to create a year-round upfront by developing a media=20exchange [between=20advertisers, media agencies and networks],"" he said.Despite Enron's pitch, Starcom has received little feedback to the letter==20from its clients, said Kevin=20Gallagher, vp and director of local investments for Starcom, which claims==20$4.3 billion in billings=20and has clients such as General Motors and Kraft. ""We're always open to new==20ways of doing=20business, and we wanted to keep our clients apprised of what's going on,"" h=e=20said. ""But we are=20not engaged in any business with Enron.

More impressive was the seven-fol=d=20increase in transacted bandwidth=20. =20Enron is =01&making excellent=20progress in creating a commodity market,=018 Skilling said. =20Seventy new broadband customers were added in the quarter, for a total of==20120.  Of that number 70%=20of the customers are carriers or network service providers, a spokeswoman==20told BMR, adding that half of=20the deals done in the quarter were with that group.Bandwidth intermediation/trading was the other key driver, with 580=20transactions posted during the=20=202000. In our view, we are=20way past the question =01&Can bandwidth be commoditized?=018 and are enteri=ng the=20period of rapid=20growth in commodity volumes which precedes the all-important emergence of==20profitability.  In the=20energy commodity markets, particularly natural gas and power in both the=20United States and=20Europe, the commodity volume growth phase lasted 1-3 years before=20profitability emerged. We=20see no reason for the bandwidth commodity market, which from a commodity=20perspective =01&looks,=20acts and feels=018 like electricity and natural gas, to perform any differe=ntly=20from these commodities.=20We are entering Year 2 of the period of rapid volume growth.

(MIR,==20news, msgs) and a joint venture between Dynegy Inc. (DYN, news, msgs) and N=RG=20Energy (NRG, news, msgs), according to two commissioners on the California==20Public Utilities Commission.=20The CPUC and the state Attorney General are investigating whether output wa=s=20withheld in order to maintain high prices over the past seven months at=20Mirant's Pittsburg plant in northern California and the Encina power plant,==20which is equally owned by Dynegy and NRG, near San Diego.=20All power plants in the state are being examined, but investigators have=20found that the Encina and Pittsburg plants have reduced power during supply==20shortages, causing market prices to rise.=20But so far, the commissioners said, investigators have found no activity th=at=20is clearly illegal.=20""Is it unethical? Yes,"" one PUC commissioner said. ""But is it illegal? No,==20unless there was collusion. This is the system we set up. What the generato=rs=20are doing would be the appropriate thing to do if you are going to maximize==20your profit to shareholders.""=20Spokesmen for Mirant and Dynegy flatly denied the charges.=20""What we did was both legal and ethical,"" said Mirant spokesman Chuck=20Griffin. ""There was a very forthright attempt to keep these plants up and==20running. Unequivocally, we have never held anything back.""=20Some of the turbines at the Encina plant are peaking units, which are=20supposed to ramp up and down to meet demand, Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel=l=20said. The plant is operated by NRG, but Dynegy markets the power from the==20plant and tells NRG how much power to generate based on what has been sold.==20""We've done absolutely nothing to manipulate prices,"" Stengell said.=20""Electricity demand increases and decreases throughout the day. Our=20production increases and decreases to follow changing demand. Ultimately, t=he=20ISO determines the exact amount of dispatch.""=20A spokesman for Attorney General William Lockyer declined to comment on the==20ongoing investigation.=20CPUC President Loretta Lynch told California newspapers last week that her==20office and that of Lockyer's have enough information to take legal action==20against generators next month, though she declined to name the companies=20involved and she said that the exact nature of the legal action is still=20under review.=20""We get really tired of these assertions with no evidence to back them up,""==20Griffin said. ""This whole idea that any generation was held back at any tim=e=20is completely bogus. It is pure political rhetoric.""=20Mirant's California power plants have run at full power during critical tim=es=20except under one of two conditions, Griffin said. Either generating units==20were broken and had to be taken off line to be fixed, or they were beginnin=g=20to run in a way that violated environmental restrictions and Mirant had to==20get permission to run at full power any longer.=20""There are no other reasons than those two,"" said Griffin.=20Nevertheless, several employees at the power plants involved have testified==20that generating units were ramped down even when the state's Independent=20System Operator had warned of tight supplies, according to one commissioner=.=20And a senior NRG employee at the Encina power plant in Carlsbad told Dow=20Jones Newswires that he was told by Dynegy's Houston trading floor to ""ramp==20down"" the large 951-megawatt plant on at least 10 occasions when he knew=20power supplies were tight.=20""We would be told to ramp down the units even when we knew the state needed==20the megawatts,"" the employee said. ""Then the spot price would go up, but we==20didn't really pay too much attention to that, because as far as we know=20everybody was doing this. We knew how much power other plants were operatin=g=20at, and we knew they weren't at full capacity.""=20NRG spokeswoman Meredith Moore said that the ISO gives instructions to Dyne=gy=20and Dynegy tells NRG what to do. ""And there have been conditions when the I=SO=20told us to ramp down during Stage 2 emergencies,"" Moore said.=20Also, one CPUC commissioner pointed out that the state's deregulation law==20doesn't require owners of power plants to bid all of their capacity into th=e=20market.=20The state's incumbent utilities, who were forced to sell their power plants==20as part of deregulation, also may have contributed to the problem, accordin=g=20to an ISO study.

"Recruiting RoundupThe big Longhorn recruiting weekend this year will be Dec. 15-17 and will b=ebuilt around the annual football banquet.Nearly all of the 19 recruits who have already committed to Texas have chos=enthat weekend to visit, and so have most of the players the Longhorns arestill recruiting.The list of players the Longhorns are still seriously recruiting iscontinuing to shrink.At this point, there are 10 recruits left on the board who (a) have offers =orwill get offers if they check out okay academically, and (b) are stronglyconsidering the Longhorns.They are DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison, LB Derrick Johnson of Waco, D=LKaelen Jakes of Valencia, Cal.; TE James Moses and DE Jonathan Jackson, bot=hof Galena Park North Shore; OL Jamie Hightower of Jacksonville, OL WilliamWinston of Houston Madison, safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple, athlete QuanCosby of Mart and DT Paul Broussard of Blinn JC.Most of the remaining six or seven scholarships will go to the players inthat group.Johnson, Jakes, Moses, Jackson and Brandon all list Texas No. 1 at thispoint, and it is possible the Longhorns will get all five of them.Winston also says Texas is tops with him right now, but he also wants to lo=okat several out-of-state schools.Harris is the remaining recruit who is No. 1 on my wish list, for twoexcellent reasons. First, he is the top DT prospect in the country. Second,he is the only top DT who is considering the Longhorns.But Oklahoma is making a big run at him, and he is listening. He also isbeing heavily recruited by Florida State and he plans to visit the Seminole=sthis weekend.Harris earlier listed Texas No. 1, but now says the Sooners and Seminoles a=rehis top two teams.He plans to visit Texas the Dec. 15 weekend, and has another trip set up toTexas A&M the Dec. 8 weekend.There actually is another top DT who is interested in Texas =01) Broussard ==01) buthe has many academic hurdles to clear.Jakes has already visited Texas, and the other nine players in that 10-mangrouping all say they plan to visit Texas the Dec. 15 weekend unless theirteams are still in the high school playoffs.Their teams will have to be really good to be still in the playoffs at thatpoint because that will be the weekend of the state semifinals in someclasses and the finals in other classes.There are some other great prospects who are  long shots, but are still inthe picture. They are headed by DT Marquise Hill, 6-6, 300, 5.0, of NewOrleans De La Salle, and DE Justin Tomerlin, 6-7, 260, of San Clemente, Cal=.Tomerlin has been committed to Florida State for several weeks, but now say=she wants to visit several other schools, including Texas. He says he still =iscommitted to FSU. I'm not sure he will visit, but, if he does, there is achance.Hill says he will take an official visit to  Texas the Thanksgiving weekendand will attend the Texas-A&M game.Hill has already visited LSU and plans to visit Michigan the Dec. 1 weekend=,Georgia the Dec. 8 weekend and Georgia Tech the Dec. 15 weekend.He said his big three are Michigan, LSU and Texas.Offensive Line (7)Jonathan Scott, 6-7, 290, 4.9, Dallas CarterAbe Robinson, 6-6, 270, 4.9, Jersey VillageAlfio Randall, 6-6, 300, 5.1, Blinn JCMike Garcia, 6-5, 280, 5.2, Galena ParkWill Allen, 6-5, 300, 5.2, Cypress FallsRoman Reeves, 6-6, 295, 5.2, LivingstonTerrance Young, 6-6, 340, 5.5, LongviewQuarterback (1)Matt Nordgren, 6-5, 225, 4.6, Dallas B.

The Cotton Bowl brass likes the Longhorns and Texascoach Mack Brown loves New Year's Day bowls.If that doesn't come to pass, then it will be either the Holiday or Alamobowl for the Longhorns.What if Texas loses to Texas A&M? I hate to consider the unthinkable, and Iwon't until and unless that happens.But if it does, we'll all need to do some research on the Insight.com Bowl,the Independence Bowl and maybe the Gallery.furniture.com Bowl.UT Women ImpressiveSophomore guard Tai Dillard scored a career-high 17 points and led threeLonghorns in double-figure scoring as Texas captured a 71-47 victory overTulane Sunday at the Erwin center in the second round of the 2000 PreseasonWomen's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT).With the win, Texas (2-0) advances to the Preseason WNIT semifinal andchampionship rounds next Sunday and Monday, at a site to be determined.Texas joins No. 9 Louisiana Tech and No. 15 Virginia in the four-teamsemifinals. No. 4 Purdue hosts Georgetown today (Monday) in the final game =todetermine the fourth semifinalist.Purdue-Georgetown winner, and Louisiana Tech versus Virginia.The Preason WNIT committee has announced that if Purdue defeats Georgetown,then the Boilermakers will serve as the host school for the Preseason WNITsemifinals Sunday and third-place and championship games Monday in WestLafayette, Indiana.If Georgetown upsets Purdue, then the Preseason WNIT semifinals andchampionship round will be hosted by Texas at the Erwin Center. The site an=dtimes will be announced late Monday.Joining Dillard in double-figure scoring were junior forward Tracy Cook, wh=otallied 12 points and senior guard JoRuth Woods, who chipped in with 11points.Woods added a team-high seven rebounds and had five assists, which tied herbest career night total.Texas shot 43.5 percent from the floor (27-of-62), while the Green Wave (1-=1)hit 41.3 percent of their shots (19-for-46).Texas shot 50% from the field in the first half en route to a 36-22 lead inthe win over Tulane.Tulane turned the ball over 26 times, while UT committed 15 turnovers.The Horns also held an advantage in steals (14 to nine), while Tulaneout-rebounded Texas, 38-37. UT also scored 27 points off turnovers toTulane's 10.Texas had advanced to the WNIT second round with Friday's 72-47 win overWichita State, while Tulane bested Grambling State, 92-64, in the firstround.Woods had 16 points and Cook  added 14 points in the victory over WichitaState in the season opener for both squads.The Longhorns, who never trailed in the game, were aided by an outstanding22-for-26 effort from the free throw line, as they hit 84.6 percent of thei=rfoul shots.The Longhorns also shot 53.3 percent from the floor and outscored theShockers 34-14 in the paint.Wichita State was held to a 29.2 percent shooting performance, as theShockers hit just 14 of 48  shots. WSU also turned the ball over 27 times,while UT committed 21 turnovers.Also scoring in double figures against Wichita State were Dillard, who had =13points, and freshman forward Stacy Stephens, who had 13 points, a game-higheight rebounds and had a game-high seven steals in her first game as aLonghorn.In both their games, the Longhorns have shown much better quickness andathleticism as a team than they showed last season.""This was a good first outing for us,"" Conradt said. ""We wanted to have astrong effort on the defensive end of the floor, and we succeeded.""""We are starting and playing a lot of young people"" she said, ""and at thispoint in time I think we have the athletic ability, the quickness and thedepth to play solid defense and press.""""Success starts with defense, and we were really good again today on ""D"",""Conradt added.

Last season, 12 of the 14 were on TV.But three games this season aren't being televised and two of them =01)Colorado and Kansas =01) are the longest road trips the Longhorns have in B=ig 12Conference play.The game in Colorado was nixed to allow Texas A&M at Baylor to be televised=,and the Kansas game this Saturday won't be televised so the Iowa State atColorado game can be aired.I know the TV folks don't worry about fan inconvenience, but UT athleticofficials certainly should and one thing they should include in the deal ifthey decide to inconvenience their fans with 11 a.m. kickoffs in earlySeptember heat is assurance that the two longest road trips on the conferen=ceschedule won't be nixed for TV.One subscriber who couldn't attend the La-La game because of his doctor'sorders told me Athletic Director Deloss Dodds should sit outside in the hea=twith the regular fans and he wouldn't ever have another 11 a.m. kickoff for=aSept. 9 game.I think most fans are willing to accept some inconvenience, but I think the=yexpect some sort of a trade off.In other words, if we need to have some early games for TV, then we shouldget preference on the TV for the faraway games, especially when they go upagainst the likes of A&M at Baylor and Iowa State at Colorado.It wouldn't have been a hard sell. But apparently no one in the UT AthleticDepartment thought enough of the fans to ask for a quid pro quo.Let's hope they do next year. After all, it takes pretty loyal fans to sellout big stadiums Saturday after Saturday when their team hasn't finished inthe top 10 in 17 long years.Horns Sign Fine Baseball ClassTexas baseball coach Augie Garrido has signed 12 of the top high schoolplayers in Texas and throughout the country.""Through the hard work of recruiting coordinator Tommy Harmon, Frank Anders=onand the entire baseball staff, we have once again been able to sign atremendous recruiting class for next season,"" Garrido said.""This group includes some of the top prospects in the state and will help u=smaintain this program's tradition of excellence,"" he added.The signees included right-handed pitchers Luis Cortez of Sinton, JoeyGuajardo of Round Rock and Donald Levinski of Weimar.Cortez, who ranks fifth in his class academically, posted a 0.82 ERA lastseason and averaged two strikeouts per inning en route to being named theDistrict 30-3A Junior of the Year.Guajardo went 11-2 on the mound for Round Rock High School during the 2000campaign and was chosen Central Texas Player of the Year after boasting a0.91 ERA, recording 172 strikeouts over 85 innings of work and pitching fou=rno-hitters.Levinski led Weimar to the Class AA State Championship last year and earnedAll-State accolades after registering a 14-1 record, an 0.70 ERA and 170strikeouts over 95 innings of work.Joining that trio is shortstop Michael Hollimon of Dallas Jesuit who batted.373 last year with seven triples and was rated the 10th best prospect atthis year's Area Code Games, plus two right-handed pitcherswho also double =asshortstops. They are Kole Strayhorn of Shawnee, Okla., who posted an 8-1record with a 0.97 ERA and 99 strikeouts over 60 innings, and Huston Streetof Austin Westlake, who not only earned second team All-Centex honors as apitcher with a 6-1 record and a 1.27 ERA last season, but is also the son o=flegendary UT pitcher and quarterback James Street.""Our focus with this recruiting class was to add depth in the middle infiel=d,behind the plate and on the mound,"" Harmon said.

He can run faster dribbling the ball thanmost players can run without the ball.He also has amazing court vision and can drill lightning-quick passes.While he is a good shooter and can dunk the ball with ease, he appears to b=emuch more interested in setting a teammate up with an easy basket.""With the signing of  T.J. and Chris, we feel like we are continuing toelevate our program,"" Barnes said.

"That explains the Sep trade.  No, the confirm they returned does not workbecause it does not reference the guarantor.  Thanks.Tiffany Williams@ENRONTanya,The May confirmation (NH9975.1) was signed and returned to me on October 19.On this confirmation, the counterparty change the name from (PII) to (PIC).Can we now say that this confirmation is valid?There was a swaption (NZ0399.1) with a trade date of 9/8/00 and an expirationdate of 9/13/00 -- that may explain the 9/13 template.  However, thatswaption was not exercised.Thanks,TiffanyWilliams/NA/Enron@Enron, Tracy Beardmore/NA/Enron@EnronI spoke with Louise Paul and she confirmed that they would like to usePaperboard Industries Corporation (PIC) as the contracting entity and wouldbe willing to provide a corporate guaranty from Paperboard IndustriesInternational (PII).I am confused as to how many trades actually exist.  Per TAGG, there are two(NH9975.1 done on May 12 and Q25809.1 done on October 4); however, in thelegal database Susan references a September 13 template sent out which LouisePaul also mentioned.  Is this a real deal or was it just a draft?As the May confirm was never signed, I do not know if we will need toactually assign it to the new entity.  We need to make sure that all of theconfirms reference PIC as the contracting entity with PII as guarantor.  Allof the credit terms apply; however they will apply to the guarantor nowinstead of the counterparty.   I have also changed the MAC trigger to B+ asPII has been downgraded from BB- to B+.  I have attached a new creditworksheet for your reference. If there are any other inconsistencies to theprevious documents other than what I have referenced, please let me know.Also, the database mentions the Enron Corp gty that was delivered inconjunction with the May trade.

The vote to elect former Montana Governor Marc Racicot was amere formality with President George W. Bush's post-election/debacledecree that Racicot should be running the RNC going into the mid-termCongressional races.It is tradition, and good policy, that the occupant of the White House,or his advisers, select the chairman of the national party so that thestrategies and messages coming out of both camps are coordinated.Because the now immediate past RNC Chairman did not fully understandthis tradition and reality, he is now out of a job.========================================================================And now... a word from our sponsor...In-House LobbyistWant to communicate effectively with elected officials?

The estimates are based on the Bureau's preliminary analysisof the 2000 census. The findings are especially troubling given the rolefailures in immigration control played in September 's terroristattacks. Not only were at least three of the September 11th hijackersillegal aliens, a number of past terrorists have also been illegalaliens from the Middle East, including Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer, who triedto bomb the New York subway system in 1997, and Mohammed Salameh, whotook part in the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993.========================================================================Non-Partisan CBO Confirms Recession and War Caused Surplus Decline --Not Tax ReliefGOPUSA News WireCrippen said &quot;over 70% of (FY2002 surplus reduction) results fromtestimony 1/23/02).

""An old news video ofLt. Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings during theReagan Administration,"" the e-mail from a friend began, ""what he saidwas stunning!"" I remember the event well.I worked with Ollie North in the Reagan White House from 1985 untilearly in 1986, when I was director of public liaison. He was acharismatic speaker, one I frequently enlisted for briefings on thesituation in Nicaragua, where the United States was trying to help agroup of guerrillas known as the Contras, who were trying to overthrowthe communist Sandinista government there. When Congress cut off fundsto the Contras, Ollie helped set up a clandestine operation to raiseprivate money for the group. In November 1986, the operation wasdiscovered, leading to the worst crisis of the Reagan administration andto criminal indictments against North (whose conviction was lateroverturned) and others involved. The Congress also held hearings inwhich North and others testified.========================================================================The GOP Abandons Its Pro-Life PlatformBy Bonnie Chernin RogoffIt is the 29th anniversary of Roe v. Wade.  Usually an anniversarysymbolizes a happy occasion, such as a wedding or a graduation or thebirth of a son or a daughter.It is only since 1973, on that ominous day 29 years ago, that Americacelebrates the deaths of her sons and daughters.  Nearly 50 million sonsand daughters to be precise.========================================================================And now... a word from our sponsor...""We're a great nation.

The writer could have also pointed out the sins of the partyregarding recent legislation such as the ""Patriot Act"" or ""AntiterrorismBill"". This legislation destroyed the Fourth Amendment and has manyother flaws.

I wish they would've gotten out there andspent at least 20 years of military service. But they didn't! Why?'Cause it's tough duty! I just don't understand them, but I dounderstand their pay raises which should be going to disabled veterans!-- Alma R. Farrar, SFC(Ret.) U.S. ArmySir, I would like to take the opportunity to thank Heather Wayman andGOPUSA for the article outlining the injustices pertaining to militaryretirees and concurrent receipt of VA disability compensation.  SHe dida wonderful job, and clearly outlined the injustice to all disabledmilitary retirees. I am a retiree of the U.S. Navy (20 years), and adisabled Vietnam Veteran. I have been paying for my own VA compensationfor almost 30 years!! I should have been a Congressman!! Thanks again,Heather!-- Frank Ray, Middletown, RIOur Military to Liberal Statesmen (Rick Erickson)The events of Mogadishu, as depicted in Black Hawk Down, bringscompelling clarity to the reality that when our sons, our daughters andour fathers who serve in the US military are commanded to put theirlives on the line; that they are allowed to quickly and decisivelyeffect defeat of their opponent without the restrictions imposed bypolitical considerations. The US military forces are an awesome powerthat should only be unleashed when we mean business, never as bluffingtool. Hoo-ah!-- Steve Findley, TXThanks to Rick Erickson for telling the truth. As a former US Navymember serving during that time and wanting to be there, most of myshipmates were outraged at what Clinton and Aspen did. I would hope thatthis information would hit the mainstream press, but I am not holding mybreath. I wonder what the public would say if they knew the real factsabout what really happened.

"Dear ST_SW Traders,FYI -There was a cut on deal # 622350.1 on June 2, 2001 for HE 11.  It was a real time cut that reduced the schedule from 40 MW to 25 MW.  Mirant is at fault for the cut. (our up-stream is PAC).We originally thought that this got booked out between Mirant and WAPA, but when I spoke with Kathy yesterday, she informed me that there was no bookout and that they want to cut the schedule.  (the people involved during the cut were Geir at EPMI, Bob at PAC, Emily at Mirant, and Jackie for WAPA (Jackie is a control area dispatcher, so she cannot do bookouts for WAPA, hence there was no bookout)).We have agreed that to cut the schedule will be the best for now.  They do not plan on charging us LD's (she's checking with her boss to make sure.)  We will just reduce the schedules to 25 for HE 11.It is up to you if you want to charge LD's to Mirant for the spread.Just wanted to let you know and get your input.Virginia","holden.salisbury@enron.com, tom.alonso@enron.com, mark.fischer@enron.com",virginia.thompson@enron.com,WAPA cut on 6-2-01,False

Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includesAlberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is notclearly categorized as ""money"" but more likely an ""account"".  Althoughcertain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including""money"", ""intangibles"", which includes ""accounts"", cannot be perfected bypossession.  The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that awire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes ""money"".  Althoughit is not clear, the better view is that ""money"" means cash in hand and noton deposit.  The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinateto various parties, including a bankruptcy trustee and to subsequently takenbut properly perfected security interests.  I will admit, however, that thisseems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likelyunknowingly).Accordingly, to perfect the ""account"" a registration is likely required atthe PPR, which is something we do not want to get into.Even then, as an ""account"" is an ""intangible"" certain conflicts rules forperfection by registration need to be considered, as the PPSA jurisdictionsprovide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of thejurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location ofits principal place of business or chief executive office. i.e.  registrationmay be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.  Further, an advancesearch would have to be done to see if there are competing priorregistrations.  Also, as the PPR is not a guaranteed title registry,registration priority does not necessarily guarantee security priority, andlaw firms will not typically give priority opinions under the PPSA.Lastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is alsoa creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the depositholding institution will assert rights of set off over the account.In terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to myknowledge changed.  I suppose there is some possibility that a court hasrecently determined that ""money"" includes deposits that we are not aware of,and I could ask outside counsel to research this issue.Peter.One of our counterparties is questioning why we won't accept cash collateralin Canada.  They claim that under the current state of the law, holding cashcollateral is the method for perfecting.  Please advise.  Should we askStikeman to update their advice to us on this?Carol St. ClairEB 3889713-853-3989 (Phone)713-646-3393 (Fax)carol.st.clair@enron.com","Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT, Greg Johnston/CAL/ECT@ECT",peter.keohane@enron.com,Cash Collateral In Canada,False

I explained our basic commercial reasons why we needed to do this tono avail.  The good news is that this, and only this agreement, may go out inyour desired format but there will be no exceptions permitted going forward.Costs incurred around future documents that do not read as true optionagreements prepared in accordance with parameters estab. with AALLP andaccounting will be considered hard costs.  Hope this helps out..Hi Herman,Thank you for your quick review of the Option Agreement with CSOB. I willcall you to discuss your comments further. However, there are some commercialreasons for combining the Wastewater Discharge and Effluent (Water reuse for1) Timing - We need to secure the wastewater discharge ability sooner than wecan pull together all of the details for a firm agreement. By highlightingthe major issues in the Option Agreeement we can confirm our discharge routewhile we pull together the details for the underlying agreement. At thispoint the Wastewater Discharge agreement that you referred to is on holduntil we have additional technical and permitting information. It is alsocritical to ensure our ability to obtain effluent for cooling, prior tofirming up all of the details for a separate, underlying agreement oneffluent.2) Combination is faster - Given the timing concerns expressed above, it isfaster to get there with one agreement rather than trying to work with theCSOB on two agreements. The proposals that we are suggesting to the CSOB arevery new and somewhat out of their comfort zone. It is easier to get themcomfortable with these concepts in one agreement and at one time rather thanin two separate agreements.As I mentioned, I will call you to discuss further, but hopefully the abovehelps shed some light on our reasons for pulling together the agreement inthis format.Regards,LauraI think this Option Agreement and Wastewater Discharge Agreement should betwo separate agreements.  What I mean by this is that the items in 1a(i)-(ix) and 1 b(i)-(ii) should be carved out of this agreement and placedin the Wasterwater Discharge Agreement.  Remainder looks ok..mwood@stoel.com; Clark, Ed; Mullen, Mark; Slaughter, Jeff; Thomas, JakeHello,Please see the attached Option Agreement. The intent of the Option is to firmup details for LED to discharge plant wastewater to the Cowlitz County sewertreatment plant's (referred to as Cowlitz Water Pollution Control ""CWPC""plant) existing outfall on the Columbia River as well as obtain wastewaterfrom CWPC for use in cooling.To give a little background, given our proximity to CWPC, the ability todischarge to CWPC's Columbia River outfall is a viable plan. It reduces thepermitting time that would be required if we built our on outfall to theColumbia. It is cheaper than sending all of the plant wastewater through thewhole treatment facility, especially given that cooling tower blowdown(primary source of plant wastewater) is very clean.We are also requesting effluent as a source of water for plant cooling giventhat the Port's ability to obtain new water rights is unclear at this point.Obtaining CWPC effluent is a viable option for plant cooling.Please contact me or Bob Carter if you have questions about this document. Iexpect to meet with the County next week to discuss. I would appreciate yourcomments mid-next week. On a priority scale, comments on this prior to theWater Agreement (sent in my previous e-mail) would be appreciated.Thank you in advance for your assistance.Regards,Laura","Bills, Lisa; Clark, Catherine; Engeldorf, Roseann; Manis, Herman","Wente, Laura",Option for Wastewater Discharge and Water Reuse,True

"FYI, I haven't reviewed yet.  Also, I told Andrea to not do anything on this.  We can decide how we want to use it.Hi Christi,Here's the draft of the affidavit, which I have sent to Andrea Settanni aswell, to review.  The analysis has two sections 1) historical trading datain the southeast, and 2)a power flow analysis of 61 different transactionsto examine parallel flows.  We found that for all types of transactionsthere are extensive parallel flows throughout the southeast (Grid South,Southern Company, Grid Florida, and Entergy), including TVA and SPP as well.SPP seems to be as tightly tied to MAPP as to Entergy and SoCo, so could goeither way (i.e. with the Southeast or with the Midwest).In addition to significant parallel flows throughout, my analysis of thetrade data showed quite a bit of marketer activity (both marketers such asEnron and Coral... and also marketing affiliates of transmission providers).To me this says that a large RTO is required because marketers are clearlyimportant participants in the electricity markets in the southeast, and theydo not confine themselves to small areas. The regions will need consistenttrading and market rules if strong competitive markets are to develop andcontinue to allow the expansion of trade.This draft should become a final version once Andrea has had a chance tocheck the content and format.

"I wanted to clarify our game plan for the next couple of weeks.1.  Tomorrow a meeting is taking place with FuelCells to resolve some majoroutstanding business issues.  At this meeting, the point is going to be madethat in order to maintain the desired schedule, FCE is going to have toincrease its technical effort.  Presently, we are concerned that thetechnical aspects of the purchase order are not in sufficient order tofinalize a purchase order by next week (we want to make certain that our dealwith FuelCells is largely defined before we make a state filing).  We aregoing to emphasize to FCE that both sides need to devote their technicalresources to this goal.  One of our priorities is to bring the technicalportions of the purchase order up to the level necessary to finalize anorder.  I need the Tony Leo list today so I can show FuelCells all theinformation that they owe us before this meeting.2.  We have redrafted the purchase order.  However, the P.O. needs refinementto reflect the resolution of the outstanding business terms and to makecertain that the technical information and procedures are clearly defined(much of the information that I sent you).  Given 1) the proposed paymentmechanics and 2) FCE's lack of mature documents, we are concerned that FCEwill try to get by with loose technical language to avoid acceptance andultimately payment issues.  Also, we are concerned that once we make ourstate filing that our negotiating leverage with FCE will go down. One of ourmajor focuses jobs between now and 11/3/00 is to make certain that thetechnical sections of the P.O. are properly defined.3.  With regard to the BOP cost estimates, I would like to get the revisedestimates no later than tomorrow.  Our current plan is to make a state filing(CRRA will make the filing and the filing will be the source of the funding)which clearly defines our basic assumptions in coming up with these estimates(we will not show the complete estimates) and to show conservative ranges.You will be given the opportunity to review and comment on the cost andtechnical information provided in the filing.  A draft of the filing is to besent to CRRA by 11/3.  Given this approach, it is less important that we goto the sites next week.  Our focus should be on getting the purchase orderinto shape (from a technical point of view) and making sure that the statefiling is accurate as to our base technical assumptions.4.  The state filing is expected to be made by CRRA in the subsequent week.Please give me a call if you have any questions.","michael.nanny@enron.com, stephen.plauche@enron.com",scott.healy@enron.com,Fuel Cells,True

"As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to ""business as usual.""   As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel.The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.  We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules.We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.All U.S.-based employees should continue to make their travel arrangements through Travel Agency in the Park at (713) 650-8080 or (800) 962-0248. Other employees should contact their local travel agency for assistance.",,40enron@enron.com,Travel Security Update,True

I think the Texas coaches better start treating Major==20Applewhite like one of the best college quarterbacks in the country, which =he=20obviously is, and start treating Chris Simms like the second-best quarterba=ck=20at the University of Texas, which he might be.

So, these next two games are=all=20about experience. But I think Simms will be back in action when UT takes on==20Missouri on Oct. 21 because the coaches are sticking with the notion of=20having two starting quarterbacks.=20=09=09I think Applewhite would be a Heisman Trophy candidate this season if he=had=20been the lone starter. It's just impossible to think of yourself as the bes=t=20player in the nation, I would think, when your coaches don't think you're t=he=20best QB on your own team.=20=09=09As far as next year, you would have to think the coaches are going to=20continue this rotation because they have not backed off of it much this=20season. We'll see.

The current charade hasn't fooled anyone. =As=20fine as Simms' =20=09=09talent appears to be, this is Major's team.  Any comments? =20=09??

And he says young players have to be used because=20veterans get tired playing offense and defense.=20=09=09I asked Mack if he thought that members of the punt team were starting t=o=20have a mental block, now that two punts have been blocked this season. He==20said he didn't know. He said the latest punt block against Oklahoma State w=as=20the result of OSU players twisting and a UT player failing to pick up the==20assignment. At least this time, the punt blocker didn't run untouched throu=gh=20the middle of the line.=20=09?=09alize=20what this team will be in a year or two. All we've heard about is how=20wonderful Mack's recruiting has been and how loaded we are, yet how the=20O-line is less than impressive and how the QB situation is hurting us.=20=09=09Guess what? Most of these ""great"" players are only 18. Remember Ricky as=a=20freshman? Didn't think so. Think about how solid we will be in two years wi=th=20current players and the new recruits coming in. So if we lose another game =or=20two this season and end up in the Poulan Weed Eater Independence Bowl, no==20biggie.=20=09=09In a year or two, we'll be right in there. So here's my question. What w=ill=20it take for Texas to be consistently rated up there with the great college==20programs? Right now, as a friend of mine would say, we have a good team and==20we're building a good program. It seems that Texas is heading in that=20direction, but we have a little way yet to go. What does Texas need to be a==20true Top 10 team? Is it personnel-based or is it about chemistry? =20=09?? Alex Kephart, Dallas=20=09t.=20The talent is there. Mack Brown is recruiting winners. But each of the line=s=20has to have experience, and there have to be some ""Braveheart""-type leaders==20on the team.=20=09=09Right now, the offensive line is still growing, even though it has two==20seniors. The defensive line has great senior tackles, but the ends are raw.==20So the defensive line probably won't be great again after this year for a==20couple years, if you believe that you need senior lines to win a national==20championship.=20=09=09But I agree with you. Texas has all the makings of being a powerhouse in=stead=20of just a good team in the next two to three years. Everyone will put the==20Longhorns back up in the Top 5 next year because of their schedule. But Tex=as=20will be a veteran team with great depth in the next two to three years.=20=09=09Right now, Texas and its fans and even the media have been guilty (me=20included) of holding Texas to the same standard as Nebaraska and Florida=20State. But that's probably not fair just yet. The stud players Brown is=20recruiting need time to settle into the system and get some experience. In==20the next couple years, Texas will justifiably be held to the same standard =as=20the perennial powers.=20=09?=09=09ve=20the longest scoring streak in NCAA football? B) If I find myself looking at==20NEXT year's schedule after a payback loss at Stanford, do I need profession=al=20help? (P.S.

That is the second-longest active streak =in=20=09=09Next year's schedule is even more appetizing than this year's schedule. =The=20only non-conference road game is at Houston. The non-conference home games==20are New Mexico State and North Carolina. And the Big 12 schedule has Colora=do=20in Austin. UT will have Oklahoma in Dallas (as usual) and Texas A=02?at Kyl=e=20Field.=20=09=09So, no, you don't need therapy. If anything, next year's schedule should=be=20another reason to have patience with this year's team. Good times are=20obviously on the horizon.=20=09?=09=09d=20this view from anyone so ... In the mid-'90s Florida State was struggling==20early in the season with a young, talented QB named Charlie Ward (of course=).=20They were winning the early games against less-talented teams, but just=20barely. Then, they finally put Ward in the shotgun on virtually every down==20and let him do his magic.=20=09=09It was like night and day.  Basically, what they did was abandon their m=ore=20balanced attack and did what their talent dictated they could do - pass ear=ly=20and often. The run was still used, but it was more to complement the pass.==20=09=09I know UT is not in the exact situation, but this may make sense for the=m.=20The only time I thought the UT offense looked really good this year was rig=ht=20when Major Applewhite first came in against Louisiana-Lafayette and drove==20straight down the field. And, Major took almost every snap in the shotgun (=at=20least the first drive). I know it was against an inferior opponent that was==20probably taken by surprise, but they showed more on those drives with Major==20in the first and second quarter than they have the rest of the season (so==20far).=20=09=09I believe you CAN win in college football with an unbalanced attack. FSU=has=20done it with primarily passing, and I can't begin to name all the OU and=20Nebraska-type teams that have won conference/national titles with=20one-dimensional offenses. Also, the shotgun helps Major's biggest liability=-=20his mobility.

It just seems==20like everyone in the media, and even some our own fans, want to find=20something negative to heap on the program.=09=09In my opinion, Mack and the rest of the team do not deserve this. Mack, =his=20coaches and the players have been nothing short of genuine and up-front wit=h=20the media and the public. They have expressed confidence, but never boasted==20about their greatness.

So people look for cracks =in=20the foundation to bring up.=20=09=09It's like in political campaigns. The media tends to build up a candidat=e and=20then when the first negative story comes out, they re-evaluate, and if some==20bad trends continue, that candidate gets torn to shreds. It all feeds on=20itself. But inevitably there is a settling period.=09=09I think the people who are quick to say that Texas isn't as good as we==20believed will calm down and there will be another story to cover.

They sound like a bunch of whining Aggies.=20=09=09Having said that, I still can't help but wonder if we don't have a probl=em=20with our offensive line coach. According to the UT media guide, Coach Tim==20Nunez has had very little experience as an offensive line coach prior to=20coming here. He didn't play that position either. There is no track record =of=20having actually developed a line, since he inherited experienced lines at==20both Marshall and UT.=20=09=09This group clearly hasn't improved, even though it was a major source of==20concern after last season. Nunez may be a fine coach and a great recruiter,==20but does anyone think that he is one of the top O-line coaches in the=20country? Is he the one who we want developing the fine group of incoming li=ne=20recruits we have committed for next year?=20=09he=20offensive line doesn't show any progress by the end of the year, then it's==20time to talk about whether coaches have done their jobs.

You are correct in that the original ENA/Instinetagreement will be utilized.  However, Instinet needs to review the agencyarrangement before proceeding.You are also correct about the ITG agreement.

Therefore, I would presume that the Instinetagreement should just be an addendum to existing documentation.  ThePosit/ITG agreement will have to be an entirely new agreement because theownership structure of ITG Europe is different than that of the States.

On Wednesday afternoon, the bond-rating agency Fitch up=dated its opinion on Enron by stating it believed ""there have been signific=ant cash collateral calls from wholesale trading customers well in excess o=f previous expectations.""=20Glenn Reynolds, chief executive of independent debt-research firm CreditSig=hts and a former chief credit officer at Lehman Bros., said the swaps marke=t is a very large but arcane investment arena that isn't followed by mainst=ream corporate bond analysts or equity analysts. Yet, he noted, ""it's one o=f the biggest things that can still go badly wrong for Enron.""How much is Enron on the hook for?Swaps exposure thus makes December a make-or-break month for the company, a=s its counterparties in complex deals glued together with billions in borro=wed funds frantically attempt to unwind positions in markets as disparate a=s currency, natural gas, bonds and metals. If Enron either made the wrong b=ets on too many of these deals, or contract covenants are breached that spu=r demands for hard-asset or cash collateral, the company could be forced to=seek the protection of bankruptcy court to prevent a run on its dwindling =treasury.Moreover, because the world of swaps and derivatives is so incestuous -- wi=th Company A able to pay its hundreds of millions in derivatives obligation=s to Company B only after it receives payments from Company C - some trader=s worry that Enron's potential inability to pay off on its swaps liabilitie=s could threaten the stability of the world's commodity-trading system.=20No one is saying that this worst-case scenario is bound to happen. But rumo=rs of default risk can spread like financial smallpox in nervous markets --=even if they're never proved true. One story making the rounds on trading =floors, for instance, tied the historic collapse of U.S. government bonds i=n the third week of November to the belief that Enron had to sell vast quan=tities of short-term Treasury notes to make good on swap-related margin cal=ls. (Enron officials did not return calls for comment.)Experts noted that Enron's counterparty risks and scant disclosure on high =levels of borrowing remind them of the spectacular blowup of hedge fund Lon=g-Term Capital Management in 1998, which imperiled the world capital market=s until the Federal Reserve captained a bailout.

Accounting protocols allow you to keep this trade off your balance =sheet, so it's not disclosed anywhere for competitors, or investors, to mon=itor. One of Enron's roles was to find a company with the opposite problem =to yours -- let's say they want to be short copper futures -- and make the =match. Thus Enron helped you swap a risk that made you uncomfortable for a =risk that you felt you could control.=20More often, Enron reportedly took the swap itself and laid off the risk by =using some other hedge, such as being long or short Eurodollars or U.S. Tre=asury notes. It might also find it profitable to be the one responsible for=actually delivering the physical product. At its peak, Enron is said to ha=ve been a counterparty on thousands of swaps per week.This business requires massive amounts of credit -- also known as ""leverage="" -- because margins are slim; the only way to become super-successful is t=o do really big volume. It turned out that few of Long-Term Credit Manageme=nt's counterparties or bank lenders understood that the hedge fund had leve=volume. And likewise, one veteran analyst who asked not to be identified t=old me that he believes Enron might have been leveraged by as much as an as=Thomas Seims, chief economist at the Federal Reserve in Dallas and an autho=rity on swaps, told me that the crux of the issue is, ""Do we know exactly w=hat their positions are -- and did they use swaps and leverage properly or =improperly? When we find out, we can determine the potential for a contagio=n effect.""=20Why don't we know what their positions are? Legally, they're not required t=o reveal them -- and we already know that Enron has done an absolutely terr=ible job of disclosing information that securities laws and investment comm=unity conventions actually require. Swaps are similar to the proprietary tr=ading operation of major brokerages, but with one critical difference. Typi=cally stocks are fairly liquid and transaction terms do not vary much. But =swap contracts can have all sorts of covenants related to the creditworthin=ess of the counterparties. So for all anyone outside of Houston knows, ther=e could be any number of billion-dollar deals hanging out there with rules =that require Enron to put up collateral or pay off loans if their debt rati=ng falls below a certain rating threshold, such as BBB-, one step above jun=k. The surprise disclosure of such a clause in a previously hidden limited =partnership contract over a Brazilian deal is what caused Enron's stock to =plunge 20% on Tuesday, according to traders.=20More importantly, one financial services executive pointed out, because Enr=on owns the market for many swaps, spread options and other thinly traded f=inancial instruments, they're the ones who set the mark-to-market price tha=t shows on their profit-and-loss statement. For example, every night an Enr=on trader must mark the value of a 15-year Chicago natural-gas swap on his =books. There is no closing or settlement price -- there's only what the Enr=on trader thinks the price should be. It is in these mark-to-market prices =of thousands of swap positions that Enron could theoretically hide hundreds=of millions in unrealized losses, if it chose to.=20One prominent New York consultant to the energy risk-management industry to=ld me he's estimated that Enron could be forced to write off as much $1 bil=lion or more in failures related to its swap transactions. Why hasn't anyon=e focused on it? ""The magnitude of Enron's partnership problems is so great=that after awhile you get numb, and no one is paying attention to this par=t of their operation.""Philip K. Verleger Jr., a leading energy-industry economist and consultant,=also noted that one reason that Enron risks aren't easily quantified is th=at they ""may not be price independent."" That's an economist's way of pointi=ng out that the company -- a major player in a corner of the derivatives bu=siness called ""delta hedging"" -- may not have the capital required to maint=ain a futures position in all the puts or calls it sold to commodity produc=ers trying to offset risks that the price of things like natural gas or oil=might fall or rise sharply. If prices maintain above or below a level that=Enron forecast as likely to make it money in such a transaction, no proble=m. But if prices in the commodity change unexpectedly -- as oil prices did =earlier this month -- then Enron could find itself deep in the hole and for=ced to lean on thinning lines of credit to pay its obligation.Whirlwind merger deal no reassuranceVerleger isn't mollified by the notion that Dynegy, which agreed to merge w=ith Enron, has studied the company's trading book thoroughly and decided it=was fine. ""Dynegy probably was not able to see its whole book in a week,"" =ould do such fast due diligence is beyond me completely."" Another trader sp=eculated that auditors at Dynegy -- a much smaller firm -- may have initial=ly given Enron a free pass on some disclosures because it was considered on=e of the cleverest and best-connected companies in the nation, with a chief=executive who was a major financial backer and friend of President George =W. Bush.Reynolds, the CreditSights executive, said that investors should beware wha=t he calls ""omission risk"" -- or the simple fact that ""what you don't see i=s what gets you every time."" He points out, for instance, that Enron had a =chance to tell investors about its ratings-related exposure in the Brazilia=n deal during a conference call with investors last week, but didn't. ""It b=oggles the mind"" that they have kicked away every opportunity to rebuild co=nfidence and credibility, he said.So what if gremlins pop out of the swaps closet? Reynolds believes that Dyn=egy will use broadly written escape clauses in its merger agreement to walk=away from its Enron merger if unexpected swap defaults -- called ""fails"" i=n the business -- emerge. He believes that Enron would then find it necessa=ry to seek the protection of bankruptcy court, because no other merger part=ner or bank is likely to follow in Dynegy's footsteps to the altar.In that event, Reynolds estimates Enron's stock -- which traded for $85 a y=ear ago -- could quickly sink to less than $2 from its current perch in the=mid-single digits. Since holders of more than 80 bonds and senior bank loa=ns would stand ahead of shareholders in bankruptcy proceedings, however, he=speculated that Enron shareholders would be lucky to end up with pennies.==20At the time of publication, Jon Markman did not own or control shares in an=y of the equities mentioned in this column,","=09Nelson, Kourtney; Cavanaugh, Darren; Stokley, Chris; Comnes, Alan; Sh=","=09Blair, Kit =20",=09Fascinating article,True

However, getting from here to there will involvesome painful adjustments, he warns, and ""monetary medicine"" from the Fedwon't stop the pain this time.According to the econometric model used by UCLA's forecasters, theprobability of a 2001 recession has increased nearly 30 percent sinceDecember 2000. Just three months ago, Dr. Leamer's forewarning of a recessionwas the most pessimistic -- and, as it turns out, the most accurate forecastmade that quarter.""The expansion of 1999-2000 was driven by 'New Economy' investmentopportunities. Firms rushed pell-mell to be the first kid on the block tohave a cool website. Fear was a big motivator. Internet firms feared losingfirst-mover advantage. Bricks-and-mortar firms feared they would lose out topure Internet business models. Almost every enterprise in the U.S. investedheavily in IT equipment and software, and hired the associated personnel,""said Dr. Leamer. ""Things are different now.""The national recession and slowdown in investment in information technologyand software has different implications for the principal regions ofCalifornia. A recession is quite likely for the Bay Area, while SouthernCalifornia will experience many economic stresses though skirting an outrightrecession.Dr. Tom Lieser, author of the California Forecast, expects to see a""high-tech"" recession in California that will have a disproportionate impacton the San Francisco Bay Area. ""We will most likely see not only a slowing ofdemand for electronics, communications equipment and related products, butalso a weeding out of the less well-capitalized firms in these industries,""said Dr. Lieser.The UCLA economist also expects a weak expansion in employment through 2002,with a corresponding rise in unemployment rates. A substantial slowdown inthe California service sector -- a mainstay of the state's economic growth --is also quite likely.""The strong increase in residential building permits seen during theNovember-January period will likely be short-lived,"" said Dr. Lieser. ""Weexpect to see declining home prices in the Bay Area this year. SouthernCalifornia will also experience slower home sales and a lower rate of priceincreases.""Higher energy prices, the economists argue, may pose a greater problem forother states than for California, because of the state's lower per capitaconsumption. On a per capita basis, California ranked 49th out of 50 inelectricity consumption and 26th in natural gas consumption, both in 1999.Even with the state's notorious dependence on the automobile, it still ranksonly 15th out of the 47 reporting states in per capita gasoline consumption.And while the recent brownouts and blackouts may not perceptibly affectCalifornia incomes and employment in the short term, a prolonged electricitycrisis could discourage business expansion significantly in the longer run.The UCLA Anderson Business Forecast is the most widely followed andoften-cited forecast for the state of California, and was unique inpredicting both the seriousness of the early-1990s downturn in California andSouthern California, and the strength of the state economy's rebound since1993.The Forecast was presented at an all-day conference at Korn Convocation Hallat The Anderson School at UCLA. In addition to providing the outlook for thestate and national economy, the conference examined the economic impact ofCalifornia's energy crisis through a series of panels led by some of thenation's most prominent authorities. Speakers included Loretta Lynch,president of the California Public Utilities Commission, Mark Bernstein,senior policy analyst at RAND Corporation, Barry Sedlik, manager, economicand business development, Southern California Edison, and Joseph M. Otting,executive vice president, Union Bank of California.","karen.denne@enron.com, susan.mara@enron.com, sandra.mccubbin@enron.com,",jeff.dasovich@enron.com,UCLA Press Release on Economic Forecast of California Economy,False

Commissioner Massey kicked off the discussionon this issue citing a transport basis differential into CA of $10, when itwas less than a dollar in other areas.  He then noted that the high gas costwould adversely affect the power price under the auction, and that FERC mustact regarding the high transport differentials- ""We will never get a handleon electric prices unless we get a handle on gas prices"".  That opened thefloodgates of discussion, culminating with the announcement by CommissionerBreathitt of FERC's technical conference (notice of which issued today) onthe topic of current and projected interstate pipeline capacity, and adequacyof infrastructure within CA.  She said that this would shed light on basisdifferentials and gas prices.Freudian slip?  Chairman Hebert was heard to say by various attendees thatprice mitigation in the WSCC would apply at all times (in contrast to theorder, which proposes mitigation only during times when reserves reach/fallbelow 7%).  Whether he mis-spoke, or not, remains to be seen.Regarding the issue of how often mitigation would be invoked in CA (i.e.,Hebert opined ""Most of the time"".Breathitt said ""Likely 80-85% of the time"".Massey was unconvinced.Several Senators railed at the Commission for ""not doing its job"" andthreatened that if the Commission did not act, Congress would act.If you have any questions or need additional detail, please feel free tocall.

Househearing was in the Barton Subcommittee (Energy & Air Quality).  Senatehearing was on last week's FERC order on a ""soft price cap"" and relatedEnergy Commission, Cal Air Resources Board, Chairman of Gov Davis GenerationImplementation Task Force.  In addition, there were witnesses from theWestern Area Power Admin and Bonneville PA.  The Senate witnesses were thethree FERC commissioners.HIghlightsChairman Barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the Bartonbill, H.R. 1647 next week (many on and off the Subcommittee doubt this willhappen; we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and willreport back with more information and conclusions once that is done);Chairman Barton also said he may go to California next week.There was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role thathigher natural gas prices into California play in the electric power rateincreases; several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportationcosts for similar differences between California and non-CA states; FERC atthe Senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technicalconference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market asit relates to California; a House member from Southern Illinois coal countryattacked California for using only natural gas in its new power plants.The House witnesses, primarily BPA but also the California witnesses,attacked the negawatt provision in sec. 102 of the Barton bill; the criticismwas that BPA would be forced to purchase power on the open market at a highprice since it is short, sell it to the DSIs under contract; let the DSI sellit at market rates and capture the difference; BPA witness said that thussec. 102 would make it difficult if not impossible to implement theirstrategy to avoid as much as a 200 percent rate increase on 10/1/01; BPAtestimony will make it tough for Members of Congress from that service regionto support sec. 102.Both hearings also touched on how difficult it would be to actually devise aprice cap; at the House hearing, none of those advocating a price cap amongthe witnesses could answer excellent questions about exactly how this couldbe done; the witnesses just said ""cost plus a reasonable profit"" and saidleave the details to FERC; at afternoon Senate hearing, Chairman Hebert hadthe staff bring in 15 boxes from one FP&L case to show how a price cap wouldtake too long to bring any relief to California this summer; he said lastweek's soft price cap is much better.Also on the price cap, Rep. Walden (R-OR)  got the Cal Energy Comm chair toadmit that if the price caps had been in place earlier, California would NOThave taken the conservation and new generation steps that it has takenrecently.The interplay among the FERC commissioners was much more contentious than itwas a House hearing on Tuesday, although it could have been worse; whenSenate Chairman Murkowski (R-AK) said that ""help is on the way"" in the formof the nominees for the two vacancies, Sen. Dorgan (D-ND) made a comment thatsuggested that the confirmation process will not be smooth; the same concerncame from the interplay among the Senators, which was also somewhatcontentious at times.Please advise if you have any questions or would like further details.","Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, James D",ray.alvarez@enron.com,House and Senate Energy Hearings Today on California/Western,False

"Per our discussion last week, this is the status on Pueblo.  I think we needto establish to our satisfaction the bona fides of Dennis' governmentcontracting scheme before we pitch hard to have ENA get into the deal andscrub down the numbers on the power plant.  If our govcon gurus (Bill Votawand Bill Gang--both ex military guys working on DOD outsourcing deals forEnron Federal Solutions) buy off on it, then I think we brief Stan at thatpoint.  You, Stan and Steve will then need to decide the best way to pitchENA to verify the economics and potentially get into the deal.  Either we'dhave Stan push from the top down or have Kevin and  Steve go directly to theENA deal guys.  More to follow.---------------------- Forwarded by Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron on 05/26/2000I just talked to Tino Monaldo, Dennis Langley's lawyer/project manager forthe Pueblo project.  I explained Bill and Bill's credentials and concerns andTino suggested that a sit down between Enron and their government contractsteam might be helpful.  He offered to do it in Houston, probably late nextweek or the following week.  Attending would be Dennis, Tino, and theiroutside lawyers, Jim Slattery and Rick Harrington.  Harrington is the key--heis a retired military guy and one of the lead govt. contracts lawyers at myold firm in DC.  The would basically put on a dog and pony walking us allthrough their sole source strategy,  including their legal interpretationsand the allies they have lined up within DOE/DOD.  Bill and Bill--does such ameeting sound productive?  If so, should we have outside govt. contractscounsel present and if so, who do you suggest?On a related note, Tino explained (without me asking or really caring) thathe was in the middle of a ""big drafting project""--revising Dennis' jointventure agreement with the Isleta.  I took the opportunity to express myconcern at how far down the road Dennis is getting on the overall deal,including structure issues, without knowing whether Enron is even on board.I reminded Tino that GPG has not committed to participating in the pipelineor the power plant, and that we have not obtained ENA's agreement to committurbines.   Apparently Dennis believes that if the economics pans out, Enronor someone else yet to be identified will magically jump in to the deal withmoney, turbines, etc.   If Enron does eventually decide to get into thisdeal, the agreements and promises that Dennis has already made may need to berevisited.

There are 2==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just tosee how it goes, and we will assume You and thoseinvolved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let'salso assume that the mailing receives only a 0.2%(2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be muchbetter but let's just say it is only 0.2%). Alsomany people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing withthis example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders forreport # 1. Those 10 people responded by sendingout 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Outof those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded withorders. That's=100 people responded and orderedReport # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for atotal of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response tothat is 1000 orders for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for atotal of 5 million e-mail sent out. The 0.2%response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails eachfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders forReport # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00(half a million dollars).2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4..... $50,000 +5.... $500,000 ....

I am an accountant with a major U.S.Corporation and I make pretty good money. When Ireceived this program I grumbled to Jody aboutreceiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the wholething, spouting my knowledge of the population andpercentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work.Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence anda few days later she jumped in with both feet. Imade merciless fun of her, and was ready to laythe old ''I told you so'' on her when the thingdidn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3weeks she had received 50 responses. Within thenext 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00........ all cash! I was shocked. I have joinedJody in her ''hobby''.

"Jerry Scarbrough's True OrangeThe Internet Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn FaithfulVolume 10, Number 25, October 2, 2000Part 1 of 2 PartsLonghorns Find Running Game Just in TimeTo Maul OSU in Big 12 Opener; OU Next FoeThe Longhorns ran over, around and through the Oklahoma State Cowboys andtheir No. 1-rated rushing defense Saturday en route to a 42-7 victory befor=ea sellout crowd in Austin.The Cowboys, while they hadn't played a good rushing team in their firstthree games, had allowed only 91 net yards rushing all season and they real=lydo have a pretty salty front seven.Led by sophomore Kenny Hayter's 122 yards, the Longhorns had 205 net yardsrushing. It was the first time Texas has has 100 net rushing yards in a gam=esince the 58-7 thumping of Texas Tech last season.In the six games they played between Texas Tech and Oklahoma State when the=ycouldn't reach the century mark in rushing, it's no coincidence that they w=onjust twice.But they utilized a new gap-blocking technique  to combat the Cowboys'stunting defense, and it worked to near perfection because Hayter, who was =alittle used third-team tailback, turned a lot of little holes into big oneswith his hard running.While the rebirth of the running game was the big overall story, it didn'thappen until the second half and UT had a shaky 10-7 lead at that point.Texas still might have lost the game without three crucial earlierdevelopments =01)  a huge passing play, a great defensive stand after stillanother special teams goof and a penalty against the Cowboys that wiped out=apotentially game-turning interception.The huge passing play, of course, was Major Applewhite's 96-yard pass-and-r=unconnection with sensational freshman WR Roy Williams six minutes deep intothe second halfThe Horns were holding a fragile 10-7 lead at the time, they were facing athird-and-14 and they had already had so many problems with  their puntingteam that UT fans everywhere were simply hoping for a miracle first down.After all, coaches everywhere say the first five minutes of the second halfis the most crucial period in a tight game, and the first five minutes hadbeen all Oklahoma State. The Longhorns hadn't even made a first down sincethe intermission.But they got a lot more than that. Williams got past the Cowboy cornerbackwho was covering him and Applewhite looked left and drew the safety backtoward the middle.When he finally looked to the right and heaved the ball, the only questionwas whether Williams could catch up to it because there are few people incollege football who can catch the fleet freshman.He did, catching it on his fingertips and racing untouched the rest of theway. That 96-yard play gave Texas a 17-7 lead and it was all downhill afterthat for the Longhorns.But that play was a gamebreaker only because the Longhorn defense stopped t=heCowboys cold early in the second quarter when a fake punt lost yardage andput OSU in possession at the UT 38, and because an interception of a ChrisSimms' pass and a long runback inside the UT 10 was negated by a personalfoul penalty against the Cowboys.The defensive stand came on the series after a blocked UT punt set up OSU'sonly touchdown. The Cowboys were leading, 7-3, and the Longhorns, at thatpoint, hadn't generated enough offense to indicate they could fall fartherbehind.The disallowed interception was a possible 10-point swing because OSU mighthave scored with a first-and-goal inside the UT 10. Instead, the Horns keptthe ball and continued a drive that ended in the field goal that opened thescoring.FIRST QUARTERNeither team threatened early, but the Horns dodged a bullet on their secon=dpossession. They started in good field possession, but Simms threw aninterception that was run back inside the UT 10 before a personal foulagainst OSU negated the play and gave Texas a first down at the OSU 29. Tex=ascouldn't move and Stockton kicked a 45-yard field goal to put the Hornsthe UT 11 on the Cowboys' next possession, but the UT defense held and theCowboys missed a chip-shot field goal try. Applewhite came in at QB forTexas. UT led, 3-0, at the end of the quarter, but the Longhorns had only o=nefirst down =01) on the penalty that negated the long interception return ==01) andjust 30 yards of total offense compared to 100 for OSU.SECOND QUARTERThe UT defense stopped OSU and forced a punt. With Applewhite still in atQB, sophomore RB Kenny Hayter got a first down on two tough runs, then seni=orTB Hodges Mitchell took a quick pitch around left end for 18 yards. ButApplewhite was sacked and his third-down pass to freshman WR B. J. Johnsonwas dropped. That was unfortunate because it forced Stockton to punt, thesnap was high, a defender got loose up the middle and the kick was blocked.Stockton covered it at the UT 30, and OSU's White scored in two plays,galloping 21 yard to the 9, then bursting up the middle untouched for thepshort, but, facing fourth and 1 at their own 40, the Horns went with a fakepunt. It was a disaster and Stockton was tackled for a two-yard loss. But t=hestrong UT defense yielded only two yards in three plays and got the ball ba=ckfor the offense. On his third try, Applewhite got the Longhorns into the en=dzone, driving 80 yards in seven plays. Mitchell got the TD on a 3-yard run,but the big plays were Applewhite's passes of 15 yards to WR MontrellFlowers, 14 yards on third-and-9 to Johnson and 36 yards to the 3 toclose enough to try a field goal as time expired, but Ervis Hill blocked it=.UT outgained OSU, 140 to 80, in the period.THIRD QUARTERA combination of mishaps, including a sack and a half-the-distance penalty,left the Longhorns facing a third and 14 from their own 4. Visions of anoth=erpunting adventure were etched into the brains of Longhorns everywhere, butApplewhite dropped back and found Williams breaking open between doublecoverage just past midfield. He heaved it and the swift freshman caught it =onhis fingertips and raced untouched into the end zone to complete a 96-yardand White misfired on a handoff two plays later and  UT LB De'Andre Lewisrecovered for Texas at the 13. Hayter powered to the 1 to set up afirst-and-goal. He tried to go over the top, but the Cowboys stopped him,then the Horns were penalized back to the 6 for a false start. Hayter gotthree yards to the 3 off right tackle, but Applewhite's pass on third downwas knocked down and Stockton's 20-yard field goal gave Texas a 20-7 leadsPon top, 26-7, heading into the final period.FOURTH QUARTERWith Hayter making good gains and Applewhite hitting key passes, theLonghorns drove 58 yards to set up a 36-yard Stockton FG and moved 42 yardsfor a touchdown, with Applewhite connecting with Flowers for the final 2yards, Ivan Williams ran 21 yards for the final score with 13 seconds left.900 Number Updated DailyI update my 900 number daily with football and football recruiting news. Th=enumber is 1-900-288-8839. It costs $1.59 a minute. You must be 18 to call.Coach's CornerCoach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorn offense had its best day of theseason against Oklahoma State, the defense did its usual fine job and thespecial teams, with one notable exception, were outstanding.""After reviewing the film, it's clear that it was the best performance we'v=ehad offensively,"" he said. ""We scored 42 points and we had no turnovers. Th=eoffensive line had its best performance.""""We were pleased with not only the offensive line, but Roy Williams made so=megreat blocks, too, and Kenny Hayter made some tough runs.""He also said junior QB Major Applewhite, who underwent off-season kneesurgery, ""played like the Major of old. He made very, very few mistakes.""The Major of old was very good. He was the Big 12 Offensive Newcomer of theYear as a redshirt freshman in 1998 and the Co-Offensive Player of the Yearas a sophomore in 1999.Applewhite and sophomore Chris Simms have been dividing time at QB, and Sim=msstarted the OSU game, but gave way to Applewhite late in the first quarter.Applewhite completed 15 of 28 passes for 291 yards and three touchdowns.Simms, who returned late in the game, completed 3 of 5 passes for 8 yards.Brown said the defense ""continues to swarm and play really well. CaseyHampton is amazing and D. D. Lewis had an outstanding day. Quentin Jammer a=ndRod Babers played really well. We had another blocked kick. that's our 12thin 30 games here. I thought it was Tyrone Jones, but it was Ervis Hill whoblocked the field goal. It's interesting that our two best kick blockers ar=eboth from Texas City.""The special teams played well, Brown said, except for having another puntblocked, and he said that is something that simply has to be fixed.""The two blocked punts this year have been in different areas,"" he said, ""b=utwe have to get it fixed. We can't keep getting punts blocked.""He said the UT-OU game was such a big game 15 or 20 years ago ""that thefeeling was that the team that won this game had a chance to win the nation=alchampionship."" He said he and OU coach Bob Stoops ""are trying to get back t=othat.""and should be ready to play against Oklahoma. He said DT Shaun Rogers(sprained ankle) is questionable for the OU game. ""We should know more abou=tShaun Tuesday,"" he said. LB O. J. McClintock also missed the OSU game(bruised knee), but he should be back this week.basically one new play - a counter with an off side guard pulling and thelinemen blocking down on the play side. The QB also handed off at least par=tof the time on one side and the back veered to the other side for a littlebit of misdirection. . . Major Applewhite's knee has been one of he major (=nopun intended) reasons the coaches have tried to use Chris Simms so much inthe early games. Applewhite still isn't 100%, but he's getting closer everyweek. In fact, he looked pretty close to 100% Saturday. That's just in timebecause the Sooners look pretty potent and the Horns need to have two topquarterbacks ready to go.Baseball Recruiting Going GreatThe UT  baseball coaches got a commitment last week from right-handed pitch=erDonald Lavinski, 6-4, 205, of Class AA state champion Weimar, giving thempledges from two of the state's big three pitching recruits. They also got =apledge from catcher Curtis Thigpen, 6-0, 175, of Forney.Round Rock's Joey Guajardo, another right-hander, committed several monthsago. The third member of the big three pitching group is David Purcey, 6-5,230, a left-hander from Dallas Trinity Christian. He is considering Texas,A&M and OU.Purcey was 21-3 at Trinity Christian the last two years and his team wonback-to-back state TAPPS' championships. He also helped his team win a stat=eTAPPS' title in basketball last year. He had 123 strikeouts in 75 1/3 innin=gslast year.Lavinski was 14-1 last year with an outstanding 0.70 ERA. His fast ball hasbeen clocked as high as 93 miles per hour and he is consistently in the 90mph range. He also has great command of a sinking fast ball and a change up=.He struck out 170 batters in 95 innings last year, while issuing about 25walks and giving up about 40 hits.He said he also had scholarship offers from Texas A&M, Baylor, Rice, Housto=nand Oklahoma State.Thigpen is an outstanding defensive catcher, but he also wields a potent ba=t,bashing opposing pitchers for a .515 batting average last season.He  also considered Alabama, Baylor and A&M.Lavinski, Thigpen and Pursey all visited Texas the September 23 weekend,along with shortstop Michael Holloman, 6-0, 165, of Dallas Jesuit.Holloman said he is considering Texas and Stanford. He visited Texas earlie=rand took his official trip to Stanford last weekend.Horns Rise in PollsThe Longhorns are No. 11 in this week's Associated Press poll and No. 10 inthe ESPN/USA Today coaches poll. Oklahoma, this week's opponent, is No. 10 =inthe AP poll and No. 12 in the coaches poll. UT is a 3-point favorite.Basketball Stars VisitKala Bowers, 6-2, of Woodward, Okla., a top national recruit in girlsbasketball, took her official visit to Texas last weekend.She is considering Texas, Colorado, Illinois and Kansas State, and says Tex=asand Colorado are her big two.Heather Schreiber, a versatile 6-2 forward from Windthorst and CoCo Reed, a5-11 forward from Jersey Village, also came to Austin last weekend.

"President Bush's statement on 201.Larry DeckerLong/Corp/Enron@ENRONPresident's Statement Regarding a Multilateral Initiative On SteelWASHINGTON, June 5 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The following was released today by theSTATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENTThis Administration is committed to free trade as an engine of growth. Aspart of our free trade agenda, we are committed to ensuring that Americanindustry and American workers can compete on a level playing field. That iswhy, today, I am announcing my intent to launch an initiative to respond tothe challenges facing the U.S. steel industry. This initiative will bedesigned to restore market forces to world steel markets and eliminate thepractices that harm our steel industry and its workers.The U.S. steel industry has been affected by a 50-year legacy of foreigngovernment intervention in the market and direct financial support of theirsteel industries. The result has been significant excess capacity,inefficient production, and a glut of steel on world markets.My decision to pursue this initiative comes after extensive consultations byMembers of the Cabinet with our industry, our steelworkers, and interestedMembers of Congress. We have discussed the challenges facing U.S. steelmanufacturers, and we understand that we have a critical stake in a healthyU.S. steel industry.Thus, I intend to take the following steps. First, I am directing the UnitedStates Trade Representative, in cooperation with the Secretary of Commerceand Secretary of the Treasury, to initiate negotiations with our tradingpartners seeking the near-term elimination of inefficient excess capacity inthe steel industry worldwide, in a manner consistent with applicable U.S.laws.Second, I am directing the U.S. Trade Representative, together with theSecretaries of Commerce and the Treasury, to initiate negotiations on therules that will govern steel trade in the future and eliminate the underlyingmarket-distorting subsidies that led to the current conditions in the firstplace. Absent strict disciplines barring government support, direct orindirect, for inefficient steel-making capacity, the problems confronting theU.S. steel industry and the steel industry worldwide will only recur.We see these negotiations and the goal of restoring market forces as being inour interest and in the interest of our trading partners and their steelindustries. That is why we would like to work cooperatively with our tradingpartners in pursuing this initiative.Third, I am directing the U.S. Trade Representative to request the initiationof an investigation of injury to the United States industry by theInternational Trade Commission under section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974.This action is consistent with our WTO obligations.This three-part strategy, coupled with further restructuring of the U.S.industry, should help the industry meet the challenges it faces. I lookforward to working together with the industry, the steelworkers, Congress,and our international trading partners in support of this importantinitiative.","richard.shapiro@enron.com, steven.kean@enron.com",lisa.yoho@enron.com,201,True

"We sold 20 MW to UAMPS heavy load hours 1/5 - 1/31.  We are using a Glendalebuy /resale from Mead 230kv to Mona to close the position.  The purchase fromGlendale is contingent on transmission from IPP to Mona.  If both 345kv linesare derated, Glendale will be forced to reduce the delivery at Mona.

This effort is led by incoming chairmanBingaman with support from Majority Leader Daschle.  They are saying theywill consider acting on the Feinstein-Smith price cap legislation unless FERCtakes unspecified additional action by the end of this month.The new track in the Senate will be in the Governmental Affairs Committeechaired by Sen. Lieberman (D-CT).  While this committee does not have thelegislative jurisdiction over energy that the Energy Committee does in termsof moving legislation, the Governmental Affairs Committee has  broadoversight and investigatory jurisdiction over all federal agencies, includingFERC.  New chairman Lieberman held his first press conference as chairmantoday and said addressing high energy prices would be a priority.In that vein, the committee is expected to hold a hearing on June 13featuring some of the economists who wrote a letter in favor of price capslast month.  We are checking with the Republican staff to make sure that theanti-price cap economists (the majority of the discipline, of course) willalso testify.  We also brief committee members and staff with our argumentsagainst price caps and the latest publicly available market data.  On June 20the committee will hold a hearing on whether FERC has properly exercised itsduties under the Federal Power Act to make sure that wholesale power ratesare just and reasonable.  We are going to meet with the committee majoritystaff, but we presently expect this hearing to have political witnesses(i.e., elected officials, possibly including Gov. Davis).We must keep in mind that Sen. Feinstein had earlier written to ChairmanLieberman asking for a hearing on the California energy situation, includingrelationships between FERC and those it regulates (citing the NY Timesarticle involving Enron and Chairman Hebert).  There is at present noindicationi that either hearing will address this matter.  We are, as youmight imagine, paying close attention to this situation.Over in the House, Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzin has said he will writeto FERC asking them to extend the April 26 price mitigation order to theentire west and to extend it to 24/7.  He also asks FERC to see if it canimplement ""negawatts"" demand reduction administratively.  We are in theprocess of obtaining a copy of the letter, which has not yet been made public.Also in the House, we expect congressional committees to begin marking upportions of the President's energy legislation and related topics as themonth unfolds.","steven.kean@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com,",john.shelk@enron.com,Legislative Update -- Two Track In The Senate and House Update,False

With all the uncertainty surrounding this company now plus I know that you had had enough of risk that it doesn't surprise me.Good luck with the new job and let me know what exactly you will be doing at the new company.Jay.Hey Jay,Just wanted to let you know that I resigned from Enron yesterday and took my job back at Wilkens Weather.   No, just kidding -with Energy USA over in the Galleria area.  They are a smaller, less sexier and more conservative company than Enron but then we all know what can happen to a ""sexy"" company.Anyway, I wish the best of luck to you in your future endeavors.  Keep in touch -you can use this address for now until I know my new address at work.  You never know if one may have to return a favor sometime in the future.See ya,JR**********************************************************************This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient (s).

"Gerald,  good to hear from you and very belated congrats on your lawdegree/bar exam/ascent to layerhood deal.  That's way cool.  Sounds like youare really doing well out there.  Tool belts, house restoration, sounds likefun.  Too bad the Navy won't allow me the time to do it.   Regardless,they've been moving me around so much lately that it's all pointless.  I gotback from Italy in Feb.  I started school here in Newport, RI.  Next I'lspend 3 months in Northern VA going to school.  Then, I'll meet my ship inthe Persian Gulf for a fun filled 4 months in the Desert.  I'm gettingpretty down on the Navy and may be considering a job change in the next twoyears.  Well, to answer your question, Michele and I have three kids now.Kelly is four, Carson is three, and Katherine (Kate) is two months (born4/15/99).  I figure we're done for now but will have to check back when Kateis too big to cuddle.  Good to hear George and Ernie are still doing well.Crazy days we had together.  Funny how we all tend to grow up eventually.My parents are fine.  They are almost finished with the house on the ranch.When that is done, they plan to move out there permanently.  John is workingsemi-part time as a governemnt employee counting fish on alaskan fishingboats.  Dangerous job/low pay.  But he likes it and he has his summers forsurfing expeditions (i.e.  he is still bumming around).   Mark is thebiggest suprise, he went back to school and got a Masters degree in libraryscience and information technology.  He did really well and now has a jobwith Microsoft working as an archiver (apparently librarians and computergeeks too now).  Hey good to hear from you.   don't know when/how we canwork in a visit.

"*  I saw this in yesterday's business sectionMontana 's power crisis may be more intense thanCalifornia'sBy JIM ROBBINSNew York TimesBUTTE, Mont. - The last large-scale metal mine is silent in this city thatsits astride the Rocky Mountains.The 170-ton, house-sized ore-hauling trucks, which once rumbled with loads 24hours a day, have not fired up their engines since last summer. Nor have theconveyors, the crushers, the concentrators and the grinders. And most of the320 workers who carved out a living extracting copper, molybdenum and silverfrom the 600-foot deep Continental Pit have scattered to other states andother jobs.Montana Resources, which owns the mine, has been out of affordable power fornine months. At the beginning of 2000, the mine was paying $26 a megawatthour, up from $19 the year before. Last week, however, a megawatt hour cost$320.While California has grabbed most of the national headlines for a powercrisis caused by deregulation gone awry - rolling blackouts resumed therelast week - another power deregulation crisis has been unfolding here inMontana . And in some ways, it is far more striking in its impact. WhileCalifornians may be somewhat protected from skyrocketing costs, Montanans arenot. Paper companies, mines and other large industrial companies in Montanahave been laying off workers because they cannot afford to pay their electricbills. Residents are expecting their household electric costs to as much asdouble by July 2002.A growing number of Montanans want to roll back the clock to a time whentheir state, blessed with its own sources of cheaply produced power, had someof the lowest electricity rates in the country. Many residents are directingtheir anger at the Legislature, which in their view deregulated the marketfor electrical power solely at the behest of the Montana Power Co., once thestate's dominant utility.Under deregulation that took effect three years ago, Montana Power sold itshydroelectric and coal-fired generating plants to PPL Corp., the Allentown,Pa., company that sells power in 42 states and in Canada, Great Britain andLatin America.Like other owners of power generation sites, PPL has been profiting immenselyunder deregulation by charging rates based on the forces of supply anddemand. Montana Power still distributes electric power around the state, butsoon will be getting out of that business as well.The change has left large power consumers such as Montana Resourcesscrambling to survive. They have scoured the region for affordablealternatives. They have asked PPL to make at least some cheaper electricityavailable but it is unclear if that will happen. And they have lobbied theLegislature to reregulate electrical power.""We've got to play all of our cards,"" said Greg Stricker, president ofMontana Resources, as he gazed over the company's open mining pit and a giantstatue of the Virgin Mary that sits high on a mountain above it. ""We're facedwith extinction."" PPL, however, says it has no choice but to sell its powerat market prices.On a national scale, the plight of Montana , which has less than a millionpeople, is not as visible as that of California, which has 34 million. ButMontana 's experience shows what can happen when power prices spiral out ofcontrol and businesses and consumers are not protected.Montana 's power crisis is rooted in the history of the Montana Power Co. Itwas formed in 1912 by Anaconda Copper Mining to ensure power for Anaconda'sextensive mining, milling and sawmill operations. Montana Power builthydroelectric dams on 11 rivers across the state, dams that still createpower at low cost.Anaconda also was accustomed to getting its own way. The company owned mostof the state's daily newspapers until 1959 and wielded tremendous influenceamong elected officials. Anaconda, the historian Bernard DeVoto wrote,""maintained a more thorough-going ownership of Montana 's wealth, governmentand inhabitants than any other corporation has ever been able to maintain inany other state.""The Anaconda era ended in 1977 when the company was bought by AtlanticRichfield, the oil company that has since been acquired by BP. Arco closedthe mines in 1980 and the smelter in 1983. Montana Power, which had becomethe state's regulated utility, outlived its creator.By the mid-1990s, however, Montana Power was worrying about its own future.Power deregulation, a national trend, looked inevitable, and the company'sbig industrial customers already were shopping for sources of cheaperelectricity .So, trying to make a virtue of necessity, Montana Power began the process ofgetting out of the power business. It diversified, creating an Internetservice provider called Touch America. It also began to push for powerderegulation, saying it would result in lower costs and more customerchoices. The company was hoping that deregulation would make itselfattractive to investors and potential buyers.A deregulation bill, the Electric Utility Restructuring and Customer ChoiceAct, was introduced in March 1997, when the legislative session was nearlyover. Lawmakers, most of them farmers and ranchers and businessmen, approvedit hastily.To some critics of deregulation, the passage smacked of the era when Anacondadictated what the Legislature should do. Few Montana lawmakers understoodwhat was happening, said Ken Toole, a Democratic state senator and anopponent of the deregulation. ""It was a steamroller with the mantra of freemarket,"" Toole said. ""Debate took place in a compressed period of time and itwas not brought before the public.""Montana Power disputed that interpretation. Jack Haffey, its president andchief operating officer, said, ""it was not a bill pulled out of somebody'spocket and foisted on the public.""Still, Montana Power emerged with marketable power plants and its thrivingTouch America business. The company sold its power plants to PPL, investingmuch of the proceeds in Touch America. Montana Power's shares, adjusted foran August 1999 split, soared to nearly $65 in March 2000 from less than $20before deregulation. (The shares have since returned to a below-$20 range,closing on Friday at $16.48) Company insiders cashed in their stock optionsat the peak and some became rich.And, for a while at least, deregulation appeared to be working. Competitionamong power suppliers was pushing down the price of electricity . In January1999, Montana Resources' power costs fell to $19 a megawatt hour from theregulated price of $30.But starting in June 2000, Stricker said, ""the market started to go nuts.""Rising demand, coupled with a lack of new supply, pushed up prices sharply. Amegawatt hour spiked as high as $680 and then settled back into the$200-to-$400 range.The region's power crisis has been aggravated recently by a drought that hasreduced the amount of hydroelectric power generated. Steve Walsh, a MontanaResources spokesman, said the company's suppliers told it that rates couldreach $1,000 a megawatt hour in the third quarter.Montana 's labor force, meanwhile, has suffered. Since last summer, accordingto the Montana affiliate of the AFL-CIO, more than 1,000 workers have losttheir jobs in layoffs caused by power price inflation.",ca.team@enron.com,jennifer.rudolph@enron.com,montana,False

Thank you.----------------------------------------------------------------------On  preliminary review of the Draft Proposal,  I wonder whether, if adopted by the Chargeback Complainants and the Participants Committee, it should be submitted to the Commission in the Chargeback Docket, not in Judge Birchman's proceeding under the July 25 Order.  That order limits Judge Birchman to making findings of fact and certifying the record on ""(1) the mitigated price in each hour of the refund period; (2) the amount of refunds owed by each supplier according to the prescribed methodology; and (3) the amount currently owed to each supplier (with separate quantities due from each entity by the ISO, the investor owned utilities, and the State of California."" (Mimeo at 42).  If the settlement were submitted in the Chargeback docket, the Commission could refer it to Birchman with appropriate instructions as to how he should treat it when he certifies the record and his findings.  Or FERC could hold the settlement until after Birchman's report.This brings up timing questions.  The July 25 Order directed the ALJ to certify the record and findings 45 days after receiving the CAISO's hour-by-hour reconstruction of mitigated prices between October 2, 2000 and June 20 2001.  Under Judge Birchman's Order of August 14 establishing a trial schedule (attached), final ISO data won't be submitted until September 17, which pushes the certification and finding date to November 2.   We need to think about how the schedule shown in the attached order impacts the timing and method of bringing the settlement before FERC, assuming that the proposal's  wording and substance are accepted by all Chargeback Complainants and the Official Committee.Howard E.

"Please follow up w/ Paul.John L NowlanRichard this is paul comments re the note you sent a couple weeks ago reclyde and co. I support his conclusion.AM ---------------------------Paul Henkingjohn,sorry it has taken so long to reply to the copy of the fax from clyde & cowhich you passed to me some time ago.basically, i reviewed the paper from sgs on copper corrosion contamination inlpg which reviewed possible scenarios of the lpg becoming off spec during asea voyage. their conclusion was that propane which contained polysulphidescould meet the copper corrosion tests at loading but then decompose duringthe long voyage to turn the propane off spec for copper corrosion. thisposition would support what clyde & co are saying as a factor against enron'scase.the whole contamination problem, while possibly an inherent vice, was anunknown inherent vice. nobody was aware of this problem at the time ofloadings but rather the problem came to light once some of the first shipsreached their discharge ports. the sgs report also brings into account othera) unclean cargo tanks, containing sulfur from previous cargoes,b) mixing of two grades of lpg, both initially on spec,c) the use of unclean inert gas, andd) other incompatible corrosive cargoes (such as ammonia) by impropercleaning procedures.i did take the liberty to call chris clucas of dorchester maritime'stechnical department whom i met when dorchester was managing the enron ownedships. it was chris who initially sent me the sgs paper as an update to thegastech 1988 paper.it may be a good thing i did call him as he mentioned a subsequent paperissued by sgs in about 1998, by g.vermeiren, where sgs went to saudi to checktheir procedures during the time of these off spec cargo loadings. it appearsthe paper's conclusion is that unknowingly saudi may have put some pacifiersinto the propane which would have caused the copper corrosion to show as onspec. therefore, the product could have actually been off spec before it wasloaded but, due to the pacifiers, tested as on spec.in summary, i would agree with clyde & co that this should be settled,especially with the amount being discussed. i do not know where this claimstands and again apologize for the delayed reply.regards",John L Nowlan/HOU/ECT@ECT,richard.sanders@enron.com,havmann - lpg claim with underwriters,True

"Agreed.  Need to talk this morning about our exposures.Jim.You are right, but Jeff was much quicker to point out my error.  Might I be distracted by everything going on around me??Wanda.I know that SCE is taking this position.  They are simple wrong.  Unless and until we get all of our ""positive"" CTC back from the Utility, why should I even begin to consider their ""goofy"" arguments.  In addition, SCE is receiving $3.3 B which is a full payment of all Negative CTC.  If their issue is to have a Undercollection charge against all customers, that's a different policy matter.  The CPUC agreed to the idea of Negative CTC and SCE needs to pay.Also, if we are 5% of load and the Undercollection is $3.3 B, I think that SCE would be looking for $165 MM - our entire claim.  They aren't talking about 5% from our view $150 MM claim.Jim.Total debt = 6.35 BAfter they contribute all cash on their books and agree to eat a little, the PUC is allowing them to collect somewhere between $3.0-3.3B--depends on who you talk to.The total owed to ESPs is $243 MM..Jeff,Do we know how much Edison's total under collection is?  Would it be as simple as to determine their total (around $3 billion?) and  gross receivable (before any payments - 145 million) and calculate the % (around 5%)?  This would result in a pretty small percentage.  Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis.  If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st,   this % (5.7%)  would also be very small.  How do you think they will look at it?  I think we would all agree to a 5% haircut, if they would JUST PAY US!Wanda.Best,Jeff.Jeff --How would we calculate EES' ""contribution"" to SCE undercollection?Jim.They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.If you have any questions, let us know.Best,Jeff","Shapiro, Richard; Steffes, James D.; Mellencamp, Lisa; Tribolet, Michael; Sanders, Richard B.; Kean, Steven J.; Sharp, Vicki; Smith, Mike; Williams, Robert C.; Curry, Wanda; Swain, Steve; Huddleson, Diann; Calger, Christopher F.; Belden, Tim; Dietrich, Janet","Dasovich, Jeff",Getting Negative CTC Paid,True

Jeff Ader (EES) has been working with regulatory to push that this should be a retail deal (similar to the retail customers that New Power won from PECO) and not a wholesale deal.  Is this the message we want to send? I suggested to regulatory that we propose that it should be split as to allow the best pricing for the NJ utilities and for everyone to be able to participate.  They suggested that if EES has more interest than EWS (apparently they wish to take 1000MW of this), that we should push the retail.  How would retail take the ancillary and capacity risk?  Are we set up such that EES would have a better chance of winning this?  What is our interest in taking on these exposures?Can we meet later today, or tomorrow (Friday) to determine at least, how we want regulatory to proceed with the BPU.  Nick, Palmer and I had a conference call with regulatory yesterday, and want to get back to them as they will be filing with the BPU very shortly.","dana.davis@enron.com, joe.quenet@enron.com, robert.benson@enron.com,",janelle.scheuer@enron.com,NJ Standard Offer,False

He is rated as one of the nation's top 25 players and isone of the top two or three point guards.He had offers from schools all over the nation, but wound up decidingbetweenTexas, Louisville, Memphis State and Houston.I saw Ford at the State Basketball Tournament last year. He is as quick asany player I have seen. He can run faster dribbling the ball than anyone Ihave seen at the high school level. He can dunk the ball easily, too. Heaveraged 9.1 points, 9.3 assists, 5-1, rebounds and 4.8 steals forWillowridge last season.He is great at everything except shooting, and that won't bother Barnes,wholikes point guards who are more interested in distributing the ball than intheir shooting opportunities. Distributing the ball is what Ford does aswellas any point guard in the country.He had a press conference Wednesday  to announce his decision to playbasketball for the Longhorns.""I'm excited to have a chance to play for coach Barnes and the Longhorns,""hesaid. ""I just felt like Texas was the best place for me. I have a greatrelationship with coach Barnes and the other Texas coaches and I'm lookingforward to it.""But first, Ford said he hopes he can help Willowridge win another statetitle.

""We need to prove wecan play well after a win. We've been a team that never knows who's goingtoshow up, and we need to start showing up every week.""Brown said he told the players they can beat everybody left on the scheduleor lose to everybody left on the schedule, depending on how hard they workand how hard they play.He said injuries are a problem, particularly at defensive tackle. ""CaseyHampton is the only one who is healthy,"" he said. ""Shaun Rogers will play,but his ankle is still sore. Ryan Haywood has a sore shoulder and StevieLeeis still out with his foot injury.""He said he still hopes to redshirt Adam Doiron, but said, ""We might have toplay him this week. We're really thin at defensive tackle.

Combining these trading vehicles withour Henry Hub futures contract will offer market participants theadvantagesof these instruments in conjunction with one of the most liquid commoditymarkets in the world and provide greater stability to the market as awhole.The Exchange is in a unique leadership position to offer these serviceswithnatural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reaching the equivalent ofapproximately 230 trillion cubic feet and the notional value of last year'stransactions Exchange-wide totaling $3 trillion, or $14 billion per day.One half billion dollars is available to participants on each of theExchange divisions through each guarantee fund and the respective clearingmembers.EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate theexecution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futurestransaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  Thetransaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-marketquantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commoditiesand will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in theunderlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted toliquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the twoparties involved in the transaction.The clearing member representing each party will be responsible to notifythe Exchange of the amount and type of futures contracts involved, thepriceat which the futures transaction should be cleared, and the identity of theparties involved.The Exchange will also begin permitting traders to execute block trades of250 natural gas futures contracts or more in the first two nearby months atthe best bid or offer for that size.  These trades will not be permittedduring the closing range.Early next year, the Exchange will introduce a cleared Henry Hub naturalgasswaps contract, providing the marketplace with direct clearing on the mostpopular energy swaps contract over the last several year.

But a few commentsto Steve's point on siting new power plants.  I ASSUME ""SENATE ENERGYCOMMITTEE"" IS THE FEDERAL SENATE, NOT THE STATE SENATE.  I HAVE GEARED MYserious concern for anyone looking for a stable environment in which to makethe $billions in investments required for new power plants.  The desparatesearch for blame placing (of exactly the guys that would make theinvestment), the lawsuits, the simplistic, outright misrepresentations ofwhat happened and is happening, the threats of condemnation, etc. are doing agood job of making the public very uneasy and effectively destroying the""market"" that resulted in the largest initiation of investment in powerplants in the state's history.  To the point, the debt lenders are gettingless third world risk developing a plant in Brazil..."")  If the final resultof all of this is a public power agency that basically controls the grid andthe buying and selling of power, the cynic might observe that we will havetraded the accusations of greed of the present environment for a reversion tothe old environment of inefficiency and escalating rate bases.  In myopinion, there is no way that the governor's present political initiativeswill result in the number of power plants that are necessary to cover thedemand.  He may be covering the near term price/supply issues with his CDWRinitiative (I note that it is winter time and power demand is down,notwithstanding stage 3 alerts - wait until summer peak demands...), butdestroyed the desire of the long term risk takers to develop new plants inthis market.  If the politicians think the ""state"" can do the development, ICDWR or the Munis or any state agency that can make the decisions necessaryto make the investments required IN A TIMELY MANNER.    The public entitiesdo not even have the staffs to do the required work, much less the politicalenvironment to get anything done, given the continued thirst for ""doingthings right"" vs ""doing the right thing.""  Maybe we will get back to longterm power purchase agreements for the development of new power plants.  Ipoint out that the Standard Offer contracts developed by the ""State"" andentered into 15 - 20 YEARS AGO in a regulated environment by nearly 10,000 MWof QFs are STILL OUT OF THE MONEY.  (Per SCE, since the PX began in 4/98,only during August and December of last year were they in the money.  Wechecked it out - they are right.  That is astounding.  And we want to go backto that??)  Enron would be pleased to participate in long term PPAs,especially since we are developing several sites, and can make money doingthat.  But if we want to be statesmen about this, we need must get a marketparadigm back.rhetoric that each is just doing its own job, but the de facto result of thatmany agencies looking at the inevitably overlapping issues is that therequirements end up much tougher than they need to be.  Letting the statedeal with the last 3, and focusing on the US EPA because of where Steve willbe testifying, seems like the US EPA (probably through a change in law at thea. Take a leadership position in rationalizing the rat warren of districtsand basins and ERC creation and transfer restrictions.  To our utteramazement, every little district that we have gone into to develop powerplants have completely different rules and have required a completelydifferent approach re ERCs- SF Bay Area, South Coast, San Joaquin County,Kern County, Placer, etc.  ERCs are the single biggest problem we have inmoving forward on the development of over 2000 MW of new plants we have onthe books.  I point out the ERC market in the east for SOX.  SOX ERCsproduced in Ohio can  be used in a new plant in Indiana.  This is nottechnically crisp, but was a rational, political decision as part of theClean Air Act.  We need that same rationalization now in California.Granted, CA and its politics was probably the genesis of the arbitrariness ofAQMD vs county boundaries vs basin boundaries, but if we can get the state tothe table to change this, the EPA will be involved.  Leadership by all isnecessary.  When 2.5 ppm new plants are being held up, the 100 ppm plantswill continue to be used to produce the power.  Do the math and tell me ifthe pollution produced during the period of delay is worth the result.  Do itagain realizing that many of these 2.5 ppm plants will never be developed,given the difficulty.car pool requirements to reduce pollution.  If a company cannot or will notcarpool sufficiently, they can pay a fine that the district applies (I think)to general programs, like electric water heaters vs gas, electric lawn mowersvs gasoline, mass transit, etc.  Implement a similar program for powerplants. Work in concert with the local air district and the EPA to develop a+$20 million for Pastoria) which the district uses to develop credits fromexisting sources that have not yet been cleaned up  (see list 4 lines above,develop.  If it takes 10 years to develop the credits, consider issues andvalue of fact that the 2.5 ppm plant will eventually replace the 100 ppmplants.c. Stop the crusade for ever lower BACT requirements that are based on vaguerepresentations, inconclusive data and over zealous developer agreements.reduction in a 25 MW unit in LA.  Good thing to do, but based primarily onthe results of that small unit and the salesmanship of Goalline's president,we got ratcheted down on our 500 MW plant in Pittsburg to 2.5 ppm.  SCAQMDcalls to SCR vendors indicated ""we can do that"".  EPA jumped on board.Guarantees from EPC contractors with LDs for nonperformance are differentthan ""we can do that"" from an equipment supplier.  Now, EPA and others arewanting 2 ppm, again based on vague data.  Sam even advises requests toconsider ~1 ppm.   (I point out that there are ZERO frame 7Fa units inoperation at these levels in California.)  GE has told us ""absolutely not"" toa 2ppm guarantee.  However, I believe that requirements will in fact bereduced again by EPA, just because they can.  Again, do the math on delayingor stopping the development of, say, a 2.5 ppm plant (because EPA wants 2ppm) in favor of the continued operation of a 100 ppm plant.  Hugely moreresultant pollution.d. Be open minded and proactive with developers' novel methods of creatingnew sources of ERCs.  PG&E had a heck of a time creating ERCs for their OtayMesa 500 MW power plant in San Diego, ending up putting new engines in 4harbor boats and +100 garbage trucks.  Enron has several similarly dificultlooking at replacing engines in harbor boats in SF Bay, replacing engines in""yard"" locomotives in Sacramento and LA, replacing agricultural pumpingengines in the Central Valley, putting SCR technology in cement plants allover CA.)  We could take years to get these programs approved as did PG&E, orwe can take several months, with EPAs (and others) leadership.legislation to speed up the siting on new power plants.  Unfortunately, theFederal agencies do not have the time line requirements to provide theirreview on the speeded up schedules.  For example, a request of the Fish andWildlife Department for a review/permit gets put on the priority pile, firstpower lines, etc.  I understand that our Pastoria project had 65 F&Wapplications ahead of it when we applied.  And, there was no limitation onhow long they could take to get the review done.  I understand that one powerproject has waited 2 years for its review.  The only way we got our permitwas Sam Wehn begged F&W to figure a way to get it done ahead of the 65 otherapplications.  Fortunately, F&W figured that we could reapply under an EPArule in this specific case, which did have a timeline limitation.  We shouldfederal agencies involved in power plant or transmission line permitting tospeed up their review/permitting times to be consistent with the stateinitiatives to speed things up.than I to vocalize these issues.  However, from a power plant developmentpoint of view, if we want the private sector to develop MERCHANT powerplants, and I believe we do because of the enormity of the investmentrequired, we must get back to a market structure.  As I am sure Steveremembers, one of the big issues we all dealt with in ""deregulation"" wasstranded cost.  We can avoid those issues by getting the private sector tocredit worthy counterparties, lots of counterparties, etc.Elizabeth Linnell@ENRONSanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Neslage/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT,Margaret Carson/Corp/Enron@ENRON, seabron.adamson@frontier-economics.com,Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, SandraMcCubbin/SFO/EES@EES, Steve Walton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT,mday@gmssr.comSteve Kean will be testifying at the Senate Energy Committee's hearing onWednesday regarding California.

In this case, itwill be an omnibus.Please let me know if I can do anything from here.JohnJane McBride@ENRONHi John,Thanks for this, just wondering though, how do you usually get from this sortof table to the actual provisions to include in the contract.  Alan, Mark, isthere any easy way to do this?Thanks.JaneJohn Suttle@ECTMorten Erik -I recommend the credit terms provided in the attached document to be includedin the Nippon Chemi-con contract.  These are industry standard terms for acounterparty with credentials such as Nippon-Chemi-con, and these industrystandards are what will enable Enron to syndicate the credit risk if wedecide to do so in the future.After my discussion with Jonathan last week, I think it is clear that Creditis on the same page with your team in that we recognize the importance ofgetting this first deal booked.  I think that in proposing the terms of yourtransaction to the counterparty though, Enron can begin educating the marketas to the nature of the credit risk imbedded in the deal structure, and indoing so, begin setting the same standards we have in our other portfolios.The attached credit terms are not set in stone, but I think they are a goodplace to start.  I will make myself available to you and the counterparty todiscuss the credit terms, and we will be very willing to negotiate the termsin good faith.My point is simply that we should not enter into any of these transactionswithout fully discussing the credit implications with the counterparty.Please feel free to call me or write if you have any questions or concerns.Johnx30906",John Suttle/HOU/ECT@ECT,alan.aronowitz@enron.com,credit for Nippon Chemi-con,False

When I came back on friday, I completed the matrixand sent it back to the team.  Any delays on this issue are from the team,not from me.  As I remember the project, it involved work on the right of wayand therefore was covered by the blankets we have for SHPO and F&W.  Therewere no project delays in terms of permits or approvals......Larry--Any thoughts on this?  Please respond to me only.Thanks, Bill.We continue to have some ""attitude"" from this person in scheduling forEOTT. I thought you may be able to work with Scott and is people on aprocess to make this better.R2.---------------------- Forwarded by Scott Clark/OTS/Enron on 05/16/2001ronny.davenport@enron.com@EottWade - As you're probably aware of by now, on April 2nd, Carl Eby withPhillips called inquiring about a possible tie-in of the subject unit toour ""Young Deep"" pipeline system we acquired from Koch.  A question aroseas to whether or not a west to east spur existed off the north/southmainline which would be near the unit.  It was initially conveyed to methat ETS would take a backhoe out to the mainline to make thisdetermination.  I have since learned that this has been delayed due to theneed for an ""environmental matrix"", whatever that may be.  The roads tothis unit are in extremely poor condition, and the operator would like topipeline connect if possible.  Production is represented at 300 bpd.1)  Could someone explain to me the process involved in an ""env. matrix"",and why it take 2 months to determine if we have a pipeline in the ground?Is someone with ETS in Houston delaying this, if so, who is the responsibleparty?2)  Tariff on this system (NMSCC #17) is 50 cents/bbl at this time, plusPLA.  From the maps I have, it appears this system consists of around 10 to12 miles of gathering and mainline.  Current production on the system isaround 115 bpd of WTI, or $23,000/yr monetized.  The pipe in the ground isfairly new from what I've been told by my contact at Koch.  If we canmanage to tie this well in, revenue would be raised an additional$60,000/year at current tariff rates.  What costs are currently associatedwith this system?  A decision needs to be made on the economic feasibilityof keeping it operable given the current tariff rates and current/proposedthroughput, or the rates needed to keep the system viable.Bottom line, Phillips and the producer need an answer, one way or theother, so they can get on with the business of safely transporting thiscrude oil.  EOTT Pipeline needs an answer, one way or the other, so we candecide how to best manage this system.Any assistance in moving this forward and allowing EOTT to maintain someimage of credibility would be appreciated.

"BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSEnron Industrial MarketsEIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.Enron Freight MarketsDuring its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.EnronOnlineOn May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent.EnronOnline StatisticsBelow are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billionIN THE NEWSEnron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity.

"Doesn't change the order, but indicates potential issues on the 2003 Expansion.NGI's Daily Gas Price IndexBreathitt 'Uneasy' About Approach to Pipe CertificationAlthough FERC and California regulators have made a lot of headway in past months in their effort to relieve the imbalance between in-state and interstate pipeline capacity, Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Wednesday that she still is somewhat unsettled by FERC's tendency to routinely approve interstate pipe projects without giving full weight to the impact on existing shippers.""I remain uneasy about the...policies the Commission has advanced in favor of certification of interstate capacity despite the [inadequacy] of takeaway capacity and particularly the confidence with which the Commission has rejected the legitimate concerns of shippers on [Kern River's] system,"" she said during the regular FERC meeting.Breathitt's remarks were part of a concurring opinion on two orders in which FERC denied rehearing of its certificate approval for Kern River Gas Transmission's 2002 Expansion Project and California Action Project [CP01-31, CP01-106-001]. Firm customers of Kern River sought reconsideration of the certificate orders on the grounds that the expansions would result in pro-rata capacity reductions for existing shippers at Wheeler Ridge and would diminish their firm delivery rights.Despite her concerns, Breathitt noted that she was ""pleased that over the past six months the Commission has come to acknowledge that our actions in certificating the Kern River expansions could exacerbate the problems of delivering natural gas to end-users in Southern California.""Even more importantly, ""the Commission has recognized the potential degradation of shippers' firm rights resulting from the certification of additional interstate capacity is an appropriate factor in the public benefits analysis that we use to determine whether a project is in the public convenience and necessity,"" she said.Moreover, ""I am relieved that certain events are occurring in California that will mitigate congestion at Wheeler Ridge. More takeaway capacity is on the horizon, and the California PUC is considering certain regulatory relief that will facilitate the transportation of natural gas from Wheeler Ridge to Southern California markets.""Nevertheless, Breathitt urged her FERC colleagues ""not [to] lose sight of the panoply of issues we must consider in issuing natural gas pipeline certificates.""This doesn't mean, however, that she is against all new pipelines and expansion projects, Breathitt said. ""I most certainly share the sense of urgency to ensure adequate and reliable energy supplies. However, there is more to the Commission's mandate under the Natural Gas Act than simply getting more pipe in the ground.""Breathitt noted that the Commission plans to revisit the issue of the adequacy of California takeaway capacity when it takes up Kern River's pending application for its proposed 2003 Expansion Project [CP01-422]. Firm customers on the pipeline have already protested the application. They claim that Kern River has sold nearly 500,000 Dth/d of additional primary firm delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge in the three expansion projects, and that they are experiencing scheduling cuts as a result.When the Kern River 2003 expansion comes before the Commission, ""I will continue to advocate a thoughtful and coordinated approach to fostering badly needed interstate and intrastate expansion in California."".Kern River, CP01-31 (2002 Expansion Project)Rejected arguments of the Firm Customers that the project should not have been approved or, alternatively, the rights of the expansion shippers at Wheeler Ridge should be subordinate to those of the existing shippers.PG&E Gas Transmission, NW, CP01-141 (2001 Expansion)Rejected Newport Northwest LLC's assertion that requiring the expansion shippers to pay a fuel cost surcharge to recover any incremental fuel costs due to the additional compression approved for this project is contrary to FERC precedent and the policy statement on expansion facilities.These orders should be issued within the next few days, and we will circulate copies.

"Thanks for thinking of sending this to me as I always appreciate any California regulatory data.  This report came out in May and is known as the CEC's ""White Paper"" on the CA Natural Gas Infrastructure.  After Com. Woods appointment at FERC, the CEC made sure he was aware of their paper and forwarded it to FERC.  The primary thrust of the paper is in line with our position that SoCal and PG&E need to expand their take-away capacity at the border.  Interestingly the FERC issued a similar finding after the Technical Conference on the same subject was held in Wash. DC.I don't expect the CEC to do much of anything with the paper beyond the press they got for identifying one of the causes for the price spike and a shortage of gas into the state.  Let me know if you have any other questions.  gh.Glen,This is very interesting reading.

I have discussed this with both Randy andRob and they support this move.Celina is a Brazilian-qualified lawyer with a U.S. LLM who was hired a yearago as a paralegal rather than as an attorney due to her relative lack of lawfirm experience.  During the past year she has been enthusiastic in pursuingher professional development and demonstrating her capabilites as aprofessional.  She has actively sought out opportunities to take on moreresponsibility and to learn more about our business and has worked very hardto win the confidence of the lawyers and clients with whom she works.

"Travis, please look into this per my voice mail and get back to both me andRick.  MarkRick BuyMark- our fears came true on this. Well got ""stuck"" and costs will escalatesubstantially. Now is necessary to sidetrack. Did your guys find anything onthis? Rick---------------------------Mark- were you aware of this? Not a huge dollar  amount but does indicate anaked risk we didn't know we had (I think). Rick---------------------------Rollins/HOU/ECT@ECTsubjected Enron to some material risk that did not get appropriateapproval.approval of approximately $260,000 representing a cash advance request onthe Bernard No. 1 well, a 16,500 exploratory well in the Cypress Program.The request appeared pretty routine but as is our procedure, I had DonRollins check it out .   Don discovered that we had already paid our cashcall and this cash call represented our working interest partner, KelleyOil's share, which is a highly unusual situation.  Checking further wediscovered that  the well is being drilled under a farmout agreement fromKelley, who wanted to be operator.  Our guys (Thompson/Josey) wanted Enron(not Kelley)  to operate the well during the drilling phase but did not wantto be official operator of record so they set up Rozel Onshore, our prospectgenerator in Lafayette to be our surrogate operator.  Kelley was upset aboutthis and would not sign the Joint Venture Agreement unless the cash callprovisons were deleted.  Thompson/Josey and team agreed and signed theagreement which has no initials from the Legal Department.   The effect ofthis was that Rozel/Enron would have to incur all the costs then bill andcollect from Kelley.Rick, as you are aware, the cash call provision in a JOA is the primarycredit risk mitigant that an operator has to ensure that his partners paytheir share of well costs before costs are incurred.  This can beparticularly good protection if a well gets in trouble with lots of costoverruns that partners don't  want to pay.  In this case, our surrogateoperator, Rozel has no established credit with oil service companys and nomoney of his own so all services including the drilling rig are having to beprepaid by Enron 100%.  The well is heavily front end loaded with costs witha total drill and complete exposure of over $4.0 million (if thing go ok!)I discussed this with Dave Gorte and Brad Larson and we all agreed  that weare forced to fund since the well is drilling and failure to fund would shutdown operations.   Also, keep in mind that this will be an ongoing obligation(and risk exposure) during this entire drilling phase.1) The E&P merchant finance team has no business operating a deep S.Louisiana exploratory test.2)  Important provisions, like ""cash call"" should never be given awaywithout appropriate risk assessment and approval.Please call if you have questions.",Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT,Rick L Carson,Cypress Exploration Program - Operator/Cash Call Issue,True

Consequently, his comments maynot have reached a large audience.  Issuing a rebuttal, may in fact, drawmore attention to the comments and issues then they are currently receiving.I believe we should proceed with caution, and respond accordingly (withcounter comments) only when comments are solicited from us.  So far, we havenot received any telephone inquiries from media in relation to Mr. Mehta'sEnron bashing.  May be we should 'leave the stones unturned'.Let me know what you think.

He should behere for the managementconference.VinceGood afternoon Vince,Christie Patrick mentioned to me the conference that your wife recentlyattended at Stanford.

"Mike, I want to see the final costs before determining.  My understanding isthat there is still significant expenses outstanding.RegardsDelainey---------------------- Forwarded by David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 07/06/2000Mike J MillerEE&CC has forwarded the peaker fee ($9.1 MM) invoice to ENA (see at bottom).I have sent a return e-mail to Gavin Gaul and John Normand explaining thatfinal approval of this invoice will be from you.  Amy and I are waiting for abetter breakdown of overhead charges on acceleration change orders.  Once wehave the overhead issue framed out, I would then battle the fee, especiallyon Wilton Center, on a packaged basis with the overhead charges.As per the Wilton Center fee, I reviewed all of the e-mail rhetoric regardingwho is to blame for the massive construction cost overruns.  EECC/NEPCO'scupbability lies in their insistance from day one that Wilton Center couldand would be built non-union.  It was only after ENA forced the decision inlate June 1999 to build the job union (to avoid air permit intervention) thatEECC/NEPCO even began to deal with how to build the job in a unionenvironment.  Even at that point, EECC/NEPCO would not move off of buildingthe job on a cost reimbursable basis and did not properly consider otheralternatives such as fixed unit pricing (fixed price per unit quantityinstalled).  EECC/NEPCO claimed that they did not have enough time tonegotiate with the unionsor pursue other options.  However, because of theirinsistance to go non-union, they precluded the ability to negotiate until thedecision to go union was made.  According to our labor experts, breaking offunion site negotiations and building non-union is worse than just goingnon-union from the start.  In any event, if you need more detail on thissubject prior to discussing the fee with Larry Izzo, please let me know and Iwill summarize the key points.I will continue to work with Amy Spoede to tie down the remaining cost andoverhead issues.

"Based on discussions with Bill, there are deferred taxes already recorded on the books for the difference between the book basis and the tax basis in the common units, sub units and APIs.  Therefore, there is no punitive tax expense created in the 3rd quarter by executing the 140 transaction.  The book tax calculations will be just the effective tax rate (approximately 37%) multiplied by the pre-tax book gain.  Accordingly, the tax expense will not result in a non-recurring loss on the sale.  The net gain will be approximately $6 million prior to the effects of the EGM MTM income.

Burton's request, in conjunction with theSpeaker's trouble in getting enough of his members to return on their owndime (he didn't want the Assembly to pay for people to fly back from Europeanvacations for 48 hours - and few members were willing to pay for itthemselves), means there will probably not be a hearing on Hertzberg's Edisonbailout plan tomorrow.Since Hertzberg plan is different from the bill the Senate passed, Burtonwants Hertzberg to include the Senate in discussions on a solution that canget passed in both houses. Since it is not expected to be any hearing on anybills/Edison bailout before both houses return from the summer recess onAugust 20th - we look  for negotiations to occur on extending the MOU's Aug15th deadline.","john.lavorato@enron.com, louise.kitchen@enron.com, david.delainey@enron.com",kristin.walsh@enron.com,California Update 7/26/01 p.2,False

"FYI.  Wanted to forward what I'm getting from legal on the TGLO contract-clear as mud.AM ---------------------------Lauri,   From a legal standpoint, we can cut the nomination on aninterruptible agreement at our discretion.  The contract clearly gives usthis right.  I haven't specifically reviewed the contract, but I am assumingit is our standard form.  I will check this.Yes, I would consider HISD facilities to be state facilities.  The fact thatthis goes to Entex first complicates the issue.Dan,  was the intent that it be directly delivered to state facilities, or ifit ultimately ended up at state facilities?Lauri A AllenI haven't heard anything back from you guys on this.  Any insight?  I knowLinda Roberts is also working a deal with TGLO to convert bbls to mmbtuswhich could mean incremental volumes that TGLO would be trying to get intoMidcon.AM ---------------------------Dan,  Any input you have on this contract would be appreciated.Lauri A AllenGerald/Eric-I have a couple of questions regarding TGLO transport contract012-88494-202.  We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into variousMidcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go toReliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transportcontract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whetherthe gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then,considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being deliveredto them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference?I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping thecorrect transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might beif I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gasinto Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  Iwould also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for theChristmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enoughleverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily?Thanks for your help.",Dan J Hyvl/HOU/ECT@ECT,12 PM,Texas General Land Office IT Transport,False

It has a Democratic governor, two liberal Democraticsenators, and both houses of its legislature are firmly in Democratic hands.Not for nothing is it called the Left Coast.Then why, Californians now ask themselves, is their state the most troubledin the nation? Bad enough that Hollywood's writers are preparing to strike;worse that speculators in Silicon Valley start-ups are watching their stackof chips dwindle; worst of all is the unforeseen electricity shock that ismaking the state's hair stand on end.The price of electricity is soaring, yet the big electric utilities arethreatened by bankruptcy. Who's to blame?to work, cry liberal voices, those heartless capitalists drove up prices.Bring back the cool, calm days of inefficient monopolies under governmentcontrol.But in fact, the first villain is botched deregulation -- not as bad as inRussia, but 'tis enough, 'twill do.wholesale prices were freed from controls, but retail prices were not.Consumers remained seemingly protected, but the utility companies -- whichfoolishly thought wholesale prices would go down forever -- were enabled tobuy on the spot market. Legislators believing they were protecting consumersforbade long-term contracts, which are hedges against sudden pricefluctuations.This halfway dereg ran smack into the inexorable law of supply and demand.The good times of the 90's sharply increased demand for electric power. Butall sorts of obstacles were put in the way of increasing the supply of thatpower.broke, government intervention that frightens off private investment, and thedanger of an economic Big One in the state responsible for 13 percent of thenation's product.The unspoken issue in this bastion of liberalism is ''nimby'' -- the realvillain in the current supply crisis, that says ''not in my backyard'' topower plants. In San Jose, epicenter of the computer industry's drain onelectric power, New Economy voters recently rejected a new power facilitythat offended their aesthetic sensibilities. Red tape and purple rhetoric arethe reasons no major power station has been built in California in 10 years.Contrary to popular belief, electricity does not come from the socket in thewall. The steady flow of low-cost power comes from factories that convertenergy from other sources into the stuff that makes toasters pop,air-conditioners wheeze and computers beep. Unless energy is dug up andproduced in real places and transmitted through real lines, nothing comes outof the wall.Environmentalists recoil in horror at suggestions of nuclear power, now asafe and clean source of electricity, or the use of cleaned-up coal to lowerthe price of natural gas that generates it. Reducing pollution sensibly islaudable, but clean-air extremists become local heroes without tellingconstituents the danger of loss of Intel jobs and cheap electricity'shousehold convenience.The answer is not re-regulation, nor more halfwayism, nor federal bailout.When Gov. Gray Davis of California raced to Washington, D.C., to ask forwholesale price controls, he found Bill Clinton too busy carving up Jerusalemto mediate; Clinton-appointed federal energy bureaucrats offer onlypalliatives, with photo op to follow.Davis's panicked proposal to build state-owned plants (in Nevada? On themoon?) and his threat to seize the assets of ''price gougers'' may pleasesome new breed of dot-communists. But such populist pap destroys privateincentive to invest and is hardly the path for a presidential hopefulprofessing to be a centrist.After short-term action to alleviate hardship caused by past and presentpolitical-industrial blindness, our biggest state should avoid regressinginto more stultifying regulation and instead get out of the way ofstimulating supply.Why do I sound like a reformed drunk on this? Because I wrote the Nixonspeech imposing wage and price controls. They never work in peacetime. Never.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

"Certainly if we are able to generate revenue, that will be a great offset toour expenses.  At this point, we are working on a best, worst and most likelycase for a revenue model, plus getting some teeth behind our up front costs.With this info, we can size the potential and then decide how to proceed.My first note to you around disbanding Joel's group was the best overallsummary of reasons to disband the team.  In addition, Joel and his team hadrecently spent a couple of hours updating my direct report team on theprojects in which they were involved.  The update had the exact oppositeeffect that Joel wanted, I am sure.  After the two hour session, it appearedto me that the team was probably overstaffed and still adding to its girth,fulfilling IT's roles in some cases, not communicating with the rest of mydirect report team (if your role is be a liaison, then communication is anecessary component of the role), struggling to create a role for themselves,etc.  If my reaction had been to say ""what a talented group - we have tofigure out how to best utilize them"", then the outcome might have beendifferent.  But I also had concerns over quality of staff as well.  That twohour exposure created so much concern on my part that we were incurring costsfor the team without commensurate value, that I couldn't in good consciousmake any other decision after further investigation.  --SallyMike JordanThanks for this - given volume increases and our need to develop and test newsystems that is a stretch target !!

To this end, I have recently studiedpossible options for reaching the targeted savings.  To make the bestdecision on this, I have reviewed functions within my team on the basis ofcore versus non-core functions, and the inherent cost versus valueproposition.As a result, I made the decision last week to disband Joel Henenberg's team.To fulfill the role of Joel and his team in leading IT initiatives, we willlean on the appropriate IT project managers and the business sponsors/endusers.Joel and his team were told of this decision on Friday afternoon last week.Our HR rep spent some time with the team explaining the corporatere-deployment service that they all will be working through over the next fewweeks.Let me know if you have any questions regarding this.

PG&E revised the Total Volume to 981,600 MWh.  Avista didnot respond with an affirmation of the corrected volume.  Our records showthat the original volume of 982,400 is correct (there was a leap-year day inyear 2000).  The broker confirm and the PG&E revision seem to be both inerror.  Obviously any new confirm that is written between Avista Energy andEnron will have the proper Total Volume for the remaining MWh's.  Since thisAssignment references the original confirmation, our counsel recommendslanguage to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email fromBlair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&E andEnron? Please advise.(2) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 403862 showed a TotalVolume of 14,400.  PG&E accepted the confirm ""as is.""  The brokerconfirmation shows total volume correctly as 876,000 MWh's.  Therefore, bothPG&E and AVISTA screwed up.  HOwever, we acknowledge that the total MWh'sshould correctly be as per the broker confirmation.  Again, our counselrecommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (seeemail from Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable toPG&E and Enron?  Please advise.To reiterate, we realize that there will be new confirmations between Enronand Avista.  Enron has traditionally written the confirmations (Enron'sconfirm's prevail).  Therefore, the new confirms should be acceptable.  Wewould like to see those confirms in advance if possible.Lastly, time is of the essense.  We are scheduling power already for Januarydeliveries....therefore, we must act quickly on this assignment so as toprevent any problems with scheduling, etc.  I suppose that we could delaythe start dates to February 1st, 2001 if necessary.

For simplicity, I accepted all the other changes and putmine in strike-out-underline.They are confined to the direct access section, and to the provisionsregarding ""spot market service"" in particular.  Based on our negotiations, Ithink it's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as""an option to elect.""  Instead, the language in the agreement states that itis a ""backstop,"" in the event that on any given day a customer's ESP doesn'tshow up with the power.  In effect, it retains the utility's duty to serve,like the gas side, but does not expose the utility to any risk of costrecovery for the spot service provided.  I've also added provisions whichobligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at theoutset of the program (i.e., the transition date), the customer, for whateverreason fails to elect Term Service or Direct Access Service.  In both cases,the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days, after which the customermust choose Term or Direct Access Service.Please take a look at the language.  While I haven't put any ""stakes in theground"" up till now, I feel strongly about these changes (for reasons I'mhappy to discuss), and if folks have issues with incorporating it into thedocument, I'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss.  I believethat the language as proposed captures my conversation with Dorothy.In addition, I've also taken a stab at language requested by Delainey, i.e.,""what to do about DA in the interm?""  There may be better ways to craft thelanguage, but I took a shot nonetheless.Finally, I'm assuming, based on yesterday's call, that, by delivering thisdocument to the Speaker today, no one is giving their approval, support, oranything else for each and every provision.  I'm not prepared to, and cannot,do that at this time.Thanks again to all for all the effort (and to Dorothy for her patience inhearing me out earlier).Best,Jeff",jeff.dasovich@enron.com,jeff.dasovich@enron.com,REVISED Merged Leg Document,False

This product will NOT bridge into Sitara and willhave to be put in manually.The reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiplestripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date. Currently,EnronOnline canonly send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridgemonitor and will have to be manually entered into Sitara & subsequentlycleared out of the monitor.Since these transactions could flow next day, it is imperative that thesetransactions get into Sitara as soon as possible. Please read the FULLdescription below. (This product looks like a month long deal but excludesweekends. The ""Wkd"" is short for week days.)We do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to beprepared to react quickly when they do.

Cook, NERC Gene=ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=mpany.=20General Observations=20The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20=20FERC DeliverablesA great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =felt was critical. =20The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panel=ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varie=d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=nt situation.The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue =a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you=need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=o say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=he need for cautious investigation. =20heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=e ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the que=stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=be others that must be accommodated??         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=edule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=ing from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are a=llowed)?=20?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=to be addressed??         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=re those contracts?  Are there other solutions??         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=dules), or will they be required at all??         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)??         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=ly unwieldy??         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=reat each NJE as a separate entity?Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will t=ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financi=al hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=ion by the Northwest interests was false.NERC and GISBA great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a bea=uty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and=did not focus on its history.Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=t, Brownell.Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=ed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulti=ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.Let me know if you have any questions.Andy RodriquezRegulatory Affairs - Enron Corp.andy.rodriquez@enron.com713-345-3771=20","jae.black@enron.com,",andy.rodriquez@enron.com,RTO Week -- Summary of Standards and Practices Panel,True

En=ron has been regarded as one of the nation's most innovative -- though bede=vilingly complicated -- companies. Mr. Lay acknowledges that Enron, which g=rew into a colossus over the past decade with a hard-charging, in-your-face=management style, has ""lost some credibility"" with the investment communit=y.""I want to make sure we restore that credibility,"" he said in an interview =last week.=20He promises fuller disclosures, and Enron has a lot riding on whether inves=tors find them sufficient -- and soothing. Last summer, the company's stock=price hit $90 a share, giving Enron a dazzling price-to-earnings ratio exc=eeding 60. As of 4 p.m. in composite trading yesterday on the New York Stoc=k Exchange, Enron was at $37.76, up $1.41, sporting a more-conventional P/E=ratio of about 21 times this year's expected earnings.=20The stock slide has multiple causes, including uncertainty about trading pr=ofits, due to the slower economy and a drop in energy prices as well as mou=nting concerns about the difficulty that investors face in figuring out how=the company's extremely complex operations make money.=20Layer on management turnover. Earlier this month, Enron lost its chief exec=utive when Jeffrey Skilling, Mr. Lay's longtime lieutenant and handpicked s=uccessor, unexpectedly resigned after only about six months in the top job.=The 47-year-old Mr. Skilling was widely credited with helping to build Enr=on into the nation's leading energy trader and personified the company's br=ash manner. During an investor conference call in April, for example, when =a caller criticized Enron's schedule for releasing financial information, M=r. Skilling responded by calling him an ""ah."" Mr. Skilling, who is on a riv=er rafting trip, couldn't be reached for comment but others at the company,=including Mr. Lay, say it was an unfortunate word choice that continues to=haunt the company. At the time, Mr. Skilling said he regretted if anyone w=as offended by his remark.=20Though Mr. Skilling initially said his resignation was strictly for persona=l reasons, he added in a later interview that his own feelings of failure o=ver the plummeting stock price had contributed greatly to his early departu=re. The 59-year-old Mr. Lay resumed the chief executive's job that he had p=reviously held for 15 years.=20Jeff Dietert, an analyst from Simmons & Co. International in Houston, figur=es that Enron's P/E is likely to be permanently lower, though still somewha=t higher than the average for its peer group. Mr. Dietert views Dynegy as t=he premium energy stock, which will fetch the highest trading multiple.=20While Mr. Lay insists that Enron's overall operating and financial conditio=n is very strong, the unexpected exit of Mr. Skilling has some wondering if=""there isn't another shoe about to drop,"" says Carol Coale, an analyst at =Prudential Securities.=20To lessen such concerns, Mr. Lay promises to address the longtime analyst a=nd investor complaint that Enron doesn't provide enough information about i=ts extremely complex operations, which include not only construction of nat=ural-gas pipelines and power plants but the trading of an ever-expanding ar=ray of commodities. Nowadays, Enron trades everything from telecommunicatio=ns capacity to weather-linked derivative contracts.=20""I truly do not understand all their financial arrangements, and I've sent =information on their deals to accountant friends and they don't understand =them either,"" says Rebecca Followill, an analyst at Howard Weil, who refers=to Enron's accounting methods as a ""black box.""=20Yet analysts long put out buy recommendations on Enron stock, in large part=because the company has issued consistently strong earnings. In 2000, for =example, the company reported net income rose 10% to $979 million on revenu=e that more than doubled to $100 billion. Assets over the past five years m=ore than quadrupled to about $65 billion.=20""When the stock price and earnings were going up so quickly, less attention=was paid to the quality of earnings,"" says Zach Wagner, an analyst at Edwa=rd Jones in St. Louis. With the stock price down, ""Enron has to show that t=hey do have quality earnings. The only way to do that is to open up the boo=ks,"" he says.=20Mr. Lay says Enron will start putting out more detailed information on indi=vidual business segments and ""give a better idea of the profitability of va=rious businesses"" such as its wholesale-services category where a lot of bu=siness activities gets lumped.=20In another bow to criticism, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow as of Ju=ly 31 quietly ended his ownership and management ties with certain limited =partnerships. Over the past two years, Enron has placed billions of dollars=of assets and millions of shares of its stock into complex transactions wi=th these partnerships. Enron executives say the transactions were perfectly=proper and that the company asked Mr. Fastow to take part in the deals, wh=ich were done to reduce the risk of fluctuating market prices. An Enron spo=kesman says Mr. Fastow has no comment on the matter.=20Yet some analysts say they have been concerned about having Enron's top fin=ancial executive in a fiduciary position at entities that, at least potenti=ally, stood to gain if the company lost in the transactions -- and vice ver=sa. Mr. Lay says the transactions involving Mr. Fastow had become a ""lightn=ing rod"" for criticism so ""we're better off not doing it.""=20Of course, it's still a challenge trying to make sense of these transaction=s. Consider the following snippet from Enron's second-quarter report concer=ities formed in 2000, which included the obligation to deliver 12 million s=hares of Enron common stock in March 2005 and entered into derivative instr=uments which eliminated the contingent nature of existing restricted forwar=d contracts executed in 2000. . . . In exchange, Enron received notes recei=vable from the Entities totaling approximately $827.6 million. In addition,=Enron entered into share settled costless collar arrangements with the Ent=ities on the 12 million shares of Enron common stock. Such transactions wil=l be accounted for as equity transactions when settled. Enron received a $6=.5 million note receivable from the Entities to terminate share-settled opt=ions on 7.1 million shares of Enron common stock. The transactions resulted=in noncash increases to noncurrent assets and equity.""=20Reading Enron's financial statements can make ""you kind of step back and sa=y, `What?'"" says Jeff Dietert, the analyst at Simmons.=20Enron faces challenges beyond just financial opaqueness. It is owed $500 mi=llion for power delivered to California's troubled utilities -- a much bigg=er unpaid tab than analysts originally believed. In India, Enron is having =difficulty getting paid for electricity from its 65%-owned, $3-billion Dabh=ol power project because of a dispute with government officials over power =prices. Mr. Lay says Dabhol is among the approximately $5 billion in overse=as assets that Enron plans to sell over the next three years while keeping =$4 billion in such holdings.=20Mr. Lay also must create a post-Skilling succession plan. He says he will s=oon recommend to the board the names of one or two executives to join him i=n the office of chairman.=20When all is said and done, will the world really see a softer side of Enron=? ""I'm not sure that Enron is exactly humbled,"" says UBS Warburg analyst Ro=n Barone. ""But they're certainly under a new kind of pressure.""Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

It also proposes=a 12% rate hike for SDG&E.NANCY VOGEL; TIM REITERMANTIMES STAFF WRITERS08/28/2001Los Angeles TimesHome EditionB-8Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror CompanySACRAMENTO -- California regulators plan to shift roughly $250 million a ye=ar of the cost of buying power for the state away from financially troubled=Southern California Edison to Pacific Gas & Electric, which already is in =bankruptcy.=20The move, part of a draft decision issued Monday by Loretta M. Lynch, presi=dent of the state Public Utilities Commission, is a step toward completing =plans for repaying the state treasury for money spent buying electricity on=behalf of the state's three major private utilities--Edison, PG&E and San =Diego Gas & Electric.The PUC also issued a draft decision that would increase the electricity ra=tes of San Diego customers by an average of 12%.=20Another draft decision would suspend the ability of electricity customers s=tatewide to choose their own power provider. That decision was a blow to el=ectricity-generating firms, such as Enron and AES NewEnergy, which had lobb=ied hard to maintain the ability to sell directly to customers--mostly larg=e businesses--that have chosen not to buy power from the local utility.=20The five-member commission will vote on the measures Sept. 6.=20The proposals are designed to assure a flow of revenue to the state Departm=ent of Water Resources, which has been buying power for utility customers m=ost of this year. The state's power crisis saddled the utilities with so mu=ch debt that earlier this year they became financially unable to buy power =on behalf of their customers.=20The Department of Water Resources has been paying for power out of the stat=e treasury. To reimburse the treasury, the state plans to float a $12.5-bil=lion bond issue. Those bonds would be paid off by customers of the three ut=ilities.=20One of the issues before the PUC has been how much of the cost of those bon=ds should be carried by each of the three utility companies.=20The Department of Water Resources had proposed charging each utility the sa=me amount per customer. But the PUC's proposed order calls for splitting th=e cost among the utilities according to how much it costs the department to=provide power to each of them. ""The utilities argued that it was discrimin=atory to have their customers subsidizing other customers' costs,"" Lynch to=ld a news conference. ""And we agreed.""=20""Instead of giving all utilities the same allocation of cost equally,"" she =said, ""we instead dig down behind the numbers to determine how much it actu=ally costs"" to serve each of the utility's customers.=20The PUC's analysis determined that the cost of serving Edison is lower than=the cost of serving PG&E. The resulting decision shifts $500 million in pa=yments from Edison to PG&E over the next two years.=20Edison customers, however, will not see a drop in their electricity bills. =Whatever money is left over after the Department of Water Resources takes i=ts share can be used by Edison to cover the costs of its own power producti=on and purchases. The PUC is now holding hearings to determine just how muc=h of what is left over should go to Edison.=20Whether the rates paid by PG&E customers would actually go up under the PUC=proposal remains unclear. But PG&E officials condemned the shift as unfair=.=20""If adopted by the [PUC] this would lock our customers into 40% to 55% high=er rates for DWR power over the next 10 years, compared to customers of Sou=thern California Edison and SDG&E,"" the company said in a statement. ""This =massive cost shift was not proposed by DWR, discriminates against PG&E's cu=stomers, and has not been subject to public review, due process, or cost ju=stification by DWR or the [PUC].""=20The PUC's actions are intended to convince Wall Street that the state will =be able to repay the bond issue. In general, the draft orders issued Monday=mirror an earlier proposed agreement that essentially insulates the Depart=ment of Water Resources from PUC reviews of electricity rate increases. But=the decision by the PUC to alter the way the department's power-buying cos=ts are allocated among the major utilities was a significant change.=20Steve Maviglio, Gov. Gray Davis' press secretary, said the fact that the PU=C was putting in place the legal machinery necessary for the bond sale is ""=a positive step in moving the ball forward.""=20Maviglio denied that PG&E was being punished for choosing bankruptcy earlie=r this year rather than cooperate with the Davis administration on a possib=le rescue plan. ""It's all based on numbers and math; politics is not in the=equation,"" he said.=20Spokesmen for Edison and SDG&E said they needed to study the draft decision=s before commenting. The PUC will require the Department of Water Resources=to give it an updated revenue requirement in February, spelling out the ag=ency's actual expenditure for the last year. That information will be used =by the PUC to decide whether to adjust the electricity rates of utility cus=tomers up or down. Any changes would show up in customers' bills next June,=Lynch said.=20If approved by the full PUC, the proposed agreement would mean that the Dep=artment of Water Resources, which has entered into $43 billion in long-term=contracts for power, will not be subject to PUC reviews. Lynch said state =legislation gives the department the responsibility to review its own costs=.=20That lack of independent review worried consumer advocate Lenny Goldberg, a=lobbyist for the Utility Reform Network. ""Just accepting DWR at whole clot=h is an abdication of how ratepayers ought to be treated,"" he said.=20Goldberg said he hopes the Legislature passes a bill by Sen. John Burton (D=-San Francisco) that would give the PUC authority to scrutinize the water a=gency's costs.=20But Davis' advisors say such scrutiny could frighten Wall Street investors =and hurt the state's ability to sell bonds at a favorable price. The propos=ed PUC order raising electricity rates for many of SDG&E's 1.2 million cust=omers would become effective no later than Oct. 1. Rates for PG&E and Ediso=n customers were increased earlier this year. The average rate hike for SDG=&E customers amounts to 1.4 cents per kilowatt-hour--less than half of the =rate hike approved for utility customers elsewhere.=20Lynch said the proposed increase for SDG&E is lower because its customers b=ore the full cost of electricity in California's haywire electricity market=last summer. While Edison and PG&E customers were protected by a rate free=ze, SDG&E customers saw their bills double and in some cases triple before =the Legislature stepped in to cap rates last September.=20To encourage conservation, the San Diego rate hike is structured so that re=sidential customers who use no more than 130% of a baseline amount would no=t experience any increase. Baseline is the number of kilowatt-hours that su=pposedly meets the minimum needs of an average household in a particular re=gion. The average increases would be 18% for small commercial customers and=19% for industrial firms.=20The move to suspend the right of consumers to buy power directly from gener=ators would put an end to one of the major selling points for the state's f=ailed 1998 deregulation plan. Supporters of direct access, as the consumer-=choice provision is known, were especially dismayed that the PUC said it wo=uld suspend choice retroactive to July 1. Some companies, including AES New=Energy, had pushed in recent weeks to sign up new customers before the opti=on was eliminated. Those contracts would appear to be invalid if the PUC ad=opts the draft decision.=20Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the suspension of the so-called direct a=ccess program ""is incredible bad news for business.""=20""It appears the only way to escape the California energy debacle is to esca=pe California,"" she said.=20State officials have said they could not allow direct access in order to en=sure that all customers pay their share of the cost of reimbursing the stat=e for its power purchases.=20*=20Times Staff Writer Nancy Rivera Brooks contributed to this story.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

He previously held those titles for EnronWholesale Services, the energy- and commodity-trading unit thataccounted for almost all of the company's $50.1 billion in second-quarter revenue. Frevert, 46, was chairman and chief executive ofWholesale Services. He was named vice chairman, Enron said.Skilling, Enron's CEO since February, and Chairman KennethLay were the only executives in the office of the chairman, whichdecides company strategy.

But o=ther Enron executives not named to the office also may be on the CEO short =list, Lay said.=20It could take as long as two or three years to groom a successor, which wou=ld also give Wall Street time to become comfortable with the person.=20Names bandied about on Wall Street as possible successors included Mark Fre=vert, CEO of Enron Wholesale Services; Lawrence ""Greg"" Whalley, chief opera=ting officer of Enron Wholesale Services; and Dave Delainey, CEO of Enron E=nergy Services.=20Enron is also working to resolve the disputes surrounding its Dabhol power =project in India.=20Enron holds a 65 percent stake in the project, which it's seeking to sell. =But Enron says any deal must allow it to recover its approximately $1 billi=on in costs, which include $875 million of equity investment and unpaid bil=ls for power the plant has supplied.=20Lay also expects to announce some large asset sales in the next 12 to 18 mo=nths.=20Enron plans to stay on its current strategic path, which includes broadenin=g its trading into a range of other commodities.=20""We're just going to keep doing what we're doing,"" Lay said.

"1. Poor guy - how is he?2. Inappropriate.3. No intercompany moves at the moment.4. No interest.5. See Jeanie Slone - she has it.6. Get cash in.ThanksLouise.Well...  I am back and checking in with you.2)	I want your input on canceling the NY trip.  I appreciate your support in letting me proceed to this point.  The remaining benefit was to get everyone together with you to calm the nerves and set a course.  I understand you will not be able to attend.  It seems there is a general public belief (from PEC & Keyspan) that many Enron employees will not have a job after this week.  If they believe that, it is entirely inappropriate to be doing anything celebratory or we will be deemed as ruthless.  I want to make this call immediately.  We have only spent an incremental $500.00 in the reviving of this event.3)	Per my e-mail on 11/16, I want to ensure that ENA retains Deirdre McCaffrey who is currently in the freight group.  Can we please move her into my group?4)	A small investment firm has approached us with an inquiry into enovate.  They want us to sign a confidentiality to discuss further.  Your thoughts...5)	Per our conversation last week, I have not received any package at my home.5)	Is there anything productive I can do to help you?Laura","Kitchen, Louise","Luce, Laura","New York, etc.",True
"I need your expertise.  If ENA nominated this gas, and I think we did based on what I see in Unify, then we are supposed to pay for it.  So I just need to verify with you  we TOOK this gas by nominating it.Deal 1143983 on Natural Gas Pipeline Company.thanks.Sitara# 1143983.Do you have a deal number for this gas?..I contacted Mary Ellenberger.  She indicated we did receive the gas but have not paid.  I suggested that she contact you via email..Have we determined if the facts in the letter are correct?  I've confirmed that if the facts are true, the payment needs to be made.Kay.All I need to know is if ENA received the gas as stated, and if there are any extenuating circumstances which would keep us from paying.  Otherwise I believe we need to make payments in accordance with the terms of the deal.  I'll confirm.Kay.Attached is a demand letter w/ short time fuse.  Counterparty wants payment for post-petition gas delivered to Enron.  Please advise if you need commercial involvement.
