"Probleme mit Microsoft Surface Pro 7. Dear Tech Online Store Customer Service,    I hope this message finds you comfortable. I am writing to bring to your attention an issue I am having with a product I recently purchased from your store, the Microsoft Surface Pro 7. It is an impressive piece of technology in many ways, but I am experiencing a recurring problem that is becoming increasingly annoying.    I have started noticing sporadic flickering of the screen on the device during light usage scenarios, such as browsing the web or working with Office applications. This flickering does not occur constantly, but rather at irregular intervals. It started a few days after initial setup and has been persistent since then.    At first I thought it might be due to specific software, so I made sure I updated all drivers and applications, including the latest Windows updates. Despite these efforts, the problem persists. From my observation, the flickering seems to be random and not linked to any specific program or task. Sometimes it flickers during video output, and sometimes while nothing heavy appears to be running in the background.    This situation is quite concerning as it affects the usability of the device, especially when I try to work for long periods of time. The flickering seems to be becoming a distraction, and I am concerned that it may indicate an underlying hardware issue that may worsen over time.    Could you please advise me on what steps I should take next? Is there a possibility of a repair or replacement under warranty, or are there any troubleshooting steps I may have missed? Any guidance you can provide would be greatly appreciated as I rely on this device for both work and entertainment purposes.    Thank you for your prompt attention to this issue.

"Issue with Microsoft Surface Pro 7. Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,    I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring your attention to an issue I have been experiencing with a product I recently purchased from your store, the Microsoft Surface Pro 7. It's been an impressive piece of technology in many aspects, but I am encountering a recurring problem that is becoming increasingly bothersome.    I started noticing sporadic screen flickering on the device during light usage scenarios, such as browsing the web or working on office applications. This flickering does not occur constantly but rather at irregular intervals. It began a few days after initial setup and has been persistent since then.    Initially, I thought it might be tied to specific software, so I made sure to update all drivers and applications, including the latest Windows updates. Despite these efforts, the issue persists. From my observation, the flickering seems random and not linked to any particular program or task. Sometimes it flickers during video playback, and other times while nothing seems to be running heavily in the background.    This situation is quite concerning as it affects the usability of the device, especially when trying to work for extended periods. The flickering seems to become a distraction, and I am concerned it might indicate a deeper underlying hardware issue which could potentially worsen over time.    Could you please advise on what steps I should take next? Is there a possibility of a repair or replacement under warranty, or are there any troubleshooting steps that I might have overlooked? Any guidance you can provide would be very much appreciated as I rely on this device for both work and entertainment purposes.    Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

"Issues with Slack 4.23.0. Dear IT Support,    I am writing to inform you of several issues I have been experiencing with the Slack 4.23.0 app. Since upgrading to this version, I have encountered significant difficulties that are impacting my workflow.    First, sending messages has been problematic. Messages are either not going through or are being sent with a significant delay, which disrupts team communications. Additionally, I am experiencing frequent disconnections from the server, which requires me to reconnect to continue using the app. This issue interrupts ongoing conversations and causes unnecessary frustration.    In addition, there are erratic notification alerts that do not seem to correspond to actual activity. I frequently receive alerts for messages that do not appear when I check, or conversely, I fail to receive alerts for new messages. This inconsistency is making it difficult to keep up with important updates in real time.    I would appreciate it if your team could investigate these issues and provide a resolution or recommended steps.

This has significantly disrupted my work-from-home arrangements, where reliable internet connectivity is crucial. Initially, I thought this might be related to my ISP, but after several checks and consultations with them, it has been confirmed that the issue is not on their end.    To provide more details, the connection seems to drop unpredictably, sometimes even multiple times in a single hour, and at these times, no specific activity is being carried out that would overload the network. I have tried basic troubleshooting steps such as restarting the router, resetting it to factory settings, and updating the firmware. None of these measures have yielded any positive results.    Given these circumstances, I kindly request your assistance in resolving this situation as soon as possible. Perhaps there is an advanced setting or change that can stabilize the network performance of the ISR4331. Your expert guidance and support in resolving this issue would be invaluable.
